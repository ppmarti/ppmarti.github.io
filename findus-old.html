LATEST (20/6/14): 
We have moved temporarily to the Physics Research Deck (PRD)
while the new Maths offices are built.
<p>

My new office is PRD 09-305.

<p>
Relative to my old office (see instructions below) 
my new office can be found by 
travelling along the long thin building [7] (E C Stoner building) 
almost to its opposite end.

<p>
Old instructions:
Finding Room 9.18n is easy once you have found the School of Maths.
<br>
Prof Charles Taylor
has a great set of instructions for finding the
School of Maths from Leeds Station
<br>
<a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~charles/">here</a>
(scroll almost to the bottom).

<p>
<!-- P.s. Another useful room to know in Maths is 9.19a - the Staff Coffee Room!
<br>
Room 9.18n is quite close by.
