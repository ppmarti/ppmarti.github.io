<p>
Start: September 2012

<p>
Idea:
The aim is to 
try to build computers with quantum nature of physics used in software/hardware integration (rather than just ``accidentally'' as reason why some hardware components work). 
<br>
The objective for this project is to bring this problem into a form where tools from physics, 
algebra and geometry can give some traction, when used in tight integration.
The project is expected to involve...
<p>
Bleeding edge Physics (in the sense, for example, that quantum physics is functional as Engineering, but somewhat open as Physics). 
<br> 
<p>
and - serendipitously - ...
<p>
bleeding edge maths. 
<br>
Proposals for addressing the quantum computation challenge use mathematics from several areas (including category theory, diagram algebras, quantum groups,
algebraic representation theory, K-theory, integrable systems, statistical mechanics, q-spin chains and so on).

<h1>Quantum Information and some of its underlying Mathematics</h1>
At the moment this is just a place to put useful links
and 
(below) an 
<b>announcement of some positions </b> that we have available:
<p>
Quantum computer: Feynman's idea is, broadly, to use the quantum nature of 
physical systems to build a massively parallel computer.
There are several major technical obstructions to puting this into practice.
One is that this device breaks the discreteness of binary computation,
so problems have to be recoded to make computation 
computational-fault-tolerant.
<p>
One kind of discreteness that can be set up (in principle) to survive 
the quantum setting, is topological discreteness. 
(Very roughly speaking, while the precise trajectories of a collection of particles in a plane from one time to another
are obscured from us by system noise, the braiding of particle time-lines 
is a relatively robust datum.)
This leads us to study certain realisations/representations of the braid group, such as that provided by the Temperley-Lieb algebra.  

The TL algebra and its family can be studied from a number of different 
perspectives. 
From the representation theory perspective, the fundamental invariants
of TL (and several other such algebras) over the complex field
have been worked out by members of the Leeds AGIS group and their collaborators.
(Our original motivation was applications in statistical mechanics.
But the algebraic framework seems well suited, in principle, 
to mathematical studies of QI
as well. In actuality, of course, the contribution of our old representation
theory results to QI is epsilonic at best... but it does seem like a
good excuse to get involved.)
