<h1>Leeds Statistical Mechanics Discussion Group</h1>


<!--<img alt='tilting module' align="right" style='border:1px solid gray' height='230' src='q4sq310.gif'> -->


Statistical Mechanics provides intriguing applications for, and
connections between, many areas of Mathematics. This includes in
particular (but is not limited to) areas of algebraic
representation
theory, combinatorics, dynamical/integrable systems, ergodic
theory, stochastic processes, logic, analysis, and Probability
currently studied here at 
<a href="http://www.maths.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds</a>.  Accordingly we 
have a small informal study group investigating these
connections.

<p>

To get the ball rolling, Jeanne Scott chaired  initial
meetings nominally explaining Potts models, partition
functions, Tutte polynomials, matching polynomials
and so on (and hoping to provoke participants into
helping with any basic questions that arise).
Paul has contributed 
<a href="../pdf/SM1-1v1.pdf">this (draft) basic summary</a>
<a href="../pdf/SM1-1.pdf"> (very draft update here) </a>;
and slides of several past review talks are linked below.
Participants will be encouraged to contribute their own
themes and connections for discussion.
<p>

All welcome.

<h3>Spring '20 session</h3>

<h3>Winter '13 session</h3>
The plan is to address the theme:
Knots and Statistical Mechanics
<br> Please email specific suggestions to Rob or Paul.
<br> We will start by noting that the TL category is a simple analogue
(arising in Stat Mech)
of the tangle category of knots, links and tangles;
and that the PBR category is a generalisation of the TL category...

topological quantum field theory anyway?". Anyone who wants to join in 
should let Paul know.  (Our nominal aim is to eventually say something
about quantum computation; but Atiyah's and Feynman's original aims 
probably included things with stat mech connections, and we plan to 
start very broad, so this is fair game for SMDG.)

<!-- Abstract:
The quasi one-dimensional transport of Abelian and non-Abelian anyons is studied. We consider the quantum walk of an anyon that braids around islands ﬁlled by static anyons of the same type. (a) In the case of a uniform filling, Abelian anyons follow the usual quantum-walk ballistic dispersion whereas the non-Abelian (Ising model) anyons spread as a classical diffusion process. This is due to the entanglement of the walker with topological fusion degrees of freedom. (b) In the case of a random filling, we show that non-Abelian anyons maintain their diffusive behavior while the Abelian ones stop propagating - a phenomenon known as the Anderson localization.

SMDG Emails that it might be helpful to broadcast:
<pre>
(Peter to Robert, on quivers in SM)
I have attached some stuff on the connections between quivers and 
Statistical Mechanics for Thursday. I hope some of its helpful ...

0011192v3 - is a handwaving way to define a quiver in Physics

0503149v2 - is a way of defining Statistical Mechanics from quivers

jehp122005025 - is an explicit quiver for the Ising model

0302228v1 - is formally why duals aren't very well defined ideas in
             (space+time) models of Physics. The mapping is known as
             "Wick-rotation", and to further confuse the issue, Physicists
             also interchange Euclidean-time with the temperature "beta"
             in this context.

0610003v2 - is a bit more what I'm doing on "time", using a description of 
9911114v1   the singularities associated with covering maps (space+time
             -> space) called asymptotic freedom.
