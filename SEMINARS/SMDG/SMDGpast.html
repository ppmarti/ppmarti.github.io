SMDG Emails that it might be helpful to broadcast:
<pre>
(Peter to Robert, on quivers in SM)
I have attached some stuff on the connections between quivers and 
Statistical Mechanics for Thursday. I hope some of its helpful ...

0011192v3 - is a handwaving way to define a quiver in Physics

0503149v2 - is a way of defining Statistical Mechanics from quivers

jehp122005025 - is an explicit quiver for the Ising model

0302228v1 - is formally why duals aren't very well defined ideas in
             (space+time) models of Physics. The mapping is known as
             "Wick-rotation", and to further confuse the issue, Physicists
             also interchange Euclidean-time with the temperature "beta"
             in this context.

0610003v2 - is a bit more what I'm doing on "time", using a description of 
9911114v1   the singularities associated with covering maps (space+time
             -> space) called asymptotic freedom.

<pre>(Matt to Sathish, on temperature)
... (omitted -- hopefully Sathish's notes will abstract this)
