Quantum computer: Feynman's idea is, broadly, to use the quantum nature of 
physical systems to build a massively parallel computer.
There are several major technical obstructions to puting this into practice.
One is that this device breaks the discreteness of binary computation
(a barrier to errors in the classical case),
so problems have to be recoded to make computation 
computational-fault-tolerant.
<p>
One kind of discreteness that can be set up (in principle) to survive 
the quantum setting, is topological discreteness. 
(Very roughly speaking, while the precise trajectories of a collection of particles in a plane from one time to another
are obscured from us by system noise, the braiding of 
suitably prepared particle time-lines 
is a relatively robust datum.)
This leads us to study certain realisations/representations of 
 braid groups, such as those provided by the Temperley-Lieb algebra. 
<p> 
The TL algebra 
gives a microcosm of our methodology.
It 
and its family can be studied from a number of different 
perspectives. 
From the representation theory perspective, the fundamental invariants
of TL (and several other such algebras) over the complex field
have been worked out by members of the Leeds AGIS group and their collaborators.
(Our original motivation was applications in statistical mechanics.
But the algebraic framework seems well suited, in principle, 
to mathematical studies of QI
as well. In actuality, of course, the contribution of our old representation
theory results to QI is epsilonic at best... but it does seem like a
good excuse to get involved.)

Idea:
Try to build computers with quantum nature of physics used in software/hardware integration (rather than just ``accidentally'' as reason why some hardware components work). 
<br>
<p>
Bleeding edge Physics (in the sense that quantum physics is functional as Engineering, but somewhat open as Physics). 
<br> 
<p>
and - serendipitously - ...
<p>
bleeding edge maths. 
Proposals for addressing the quantum computation challenge use mathematics from several areas (including category theory, diagram algebras, quantum groups,
algebraic representation theory, K-theory, integrable systems, statistical mechanics, q-spin chains and so on).
