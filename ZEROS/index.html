<h1> Partition Function Zeros </h1>

This page is under construction. 
The initial idea was to provide some notes that would be of interest to 
my graduate student 
<a href="valani/yogi/index.html"> Yogi Valani</a>, 
who 
was studying Potts model partition
functions using transfer matrix algebra techniques (mainly computer based).
<br>
(Yogi has successfully completed his PhD, but I'll leave the notes up,
since 
they may eventually be of interest to others too.)
<br><br>
The aim is to study 
the way in which equilibrium statistical mechanics models
phase transitions (possibly multiple), by studying the 
distribution of zeros of the partition function Z 
in the complex T plain close to phase transition point. 
<br>
This is typically done by studying the exactly computed partition function
on finite lattices (arranging for the Hamiltonian to be integral, so that
Z is polynomial in exp(beta), where beta=1/kT).
<br>
<br>
This programme is comprehensively explained in the literature. 
But this literature is 
spread far and wide, and some of it is hard work. 
Accordingly, this
page will take the form, in part, of 
<br>
(1) a kind of FAQ.
The assumption is that the reader has _seen_ the literature,
but that some further explanation is useful.
<br>
(2) a collection of results and pointers to results.
(So email me if you want me to add something relevant.)
<br>
For example, 
<ul><li>
here is <a href="valani/yogi/index.html">Valani's </a> page 
containing many beautiful and intriguing Potts model examples. 
<li>
thesis results page <a href="."> here (to follow) </a> of 
<a href="http://www.iium.edu.my/staff/show/8033">Dr Fatimah Zakaria </a> (IIUM Kuantan), another of my former students.
</ul>
The figure on the right is for a clock model not a Potts model,
and animates the zero distribution over 3 different lattice sizes
(see later for details).

My main reference (just because it is something that does the job,
and that I am familiar with) is:

World Scientific 1991.

<h4>Definitions</h4>
At its simplest,
the Potts model partition function Z can be considered to be a map from pairs
consisting of a natural number and a graph, to polynomials. 
That is, for each such pair there is a polynomial. 
See
<a href="http://www.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~ppmartin/pdf/inv-thy.pdf"> here.</a>

However, the graph in question is a representation of a physical system,
such that the number of vertices is of order 10^26
(that is, of the order of Avogadro's number). 
No interesting Z can be computed for a graph of this size.
In practice, then, it is necessary to compute Z for a 
sequence of graphs approaching (in some sense) a limit, 
such that the large graph of interest may be studied by studying the limit. 
<br>
This may sound hopeless, but a good model for this situation is given in [M91]
Chapter 11. There one considers a certain sequence of graphs.
