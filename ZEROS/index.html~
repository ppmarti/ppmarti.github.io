This page is under construction. 
The idea is to provide some notes that will be of interest to my graduate student <a href=""> Yogi Valani </a>, who is studying Potts model partition
functions using transfer matrix algebra techniques (mainly computer based).
<br>
They may eventually be of interest to others too.
<br>
The idea is to study 
the way in which equilibrium statistical mechanics models
phase transitions (possibly multiple), by studying the 
distribution of zeros of the partition function Z 
in the complex T plain close to phase transition point. 
<br>
This is typically done by studying the exactly computed partition function
on finite lattices (arranging for the Hamiltonian to be integral, so that
Z is polynomial in exp(beta), where beta=1/kT).
<br>
This programme is comprehensively explained in the literature. 
But this literature is 
spread far and wide, and some of it is hard work. 
Accordingly, this
page will take the form, in part, of 
<br>
(1) a kind of FAQ.
The assumption is that the reader has _seen_ the literature,
but that some further explanation is useful.
<br>
(2) a collection of results and pointers to results.
(So email me if you want me to add something relevant.)
