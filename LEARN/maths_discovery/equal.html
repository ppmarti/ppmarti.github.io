This is a learning 
resource page for "Discovering Maths".
<br>
It is independent of any particular module or programme.

In particular the <a href="../..">Leeds</a> module

<h4> 1. What is "equality"? </h4>
<ul><li>
Think about  the image here,
and  how it might connect maths to life...
</ul>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Mug_and_Torus_morph.gif">

<ul>
<li>
We talk about equality in life. Equal rights. Equal pay. Equal opportunities.
<br>
Sameness and difference. A notion of "self".
<br>
And these are all very interesting and complex topics. And important.
<br>
<li>
Can maths help us to get a handle on these ideas? 
... Perhaps not! But we might learn something useful about maths
if we give it a try.
<br>
<li>
Maths, of course, has its own versions of equality:
<br>
2+2 = 4
<br>
Exercise: what does this mean? Discuss!
<br>
<li>
And the dictionary says two things are equal if they are the same.
<br>
When we say that you and I should have the equal rights, we mean that
we should have the same rights. And we should have the same rights because
we are the same in both being human.
<br>
Of course, both being human does not make us exactly the same.
<br>
There are important differences and important similarities.
<br>
<li>
How about me today and me tomorrow... Am I the same person?
I seem to have an idea of self -- a feeling of continuity without change.
<br>
But of course I do change from day to day. Older me might make different
choices from younger me. What does it mean to say that we are the 
same person?
<br>
This (sort of) brings us to the picture of the coffee mug...
<br>
<li>
...Maybe you see why, or maybe not! (Exercise: Discuss!)
<br>
But even if you _do_, there is another question:
What has the coffee mug got to do with maths!!?...
(Apart from the obvious.)
<li>
Well, maths codifies the sense in which stages in the `life' of the 
coffee mug are the same, and in which they are different.
<li>
<li>
Would you like to know more?
