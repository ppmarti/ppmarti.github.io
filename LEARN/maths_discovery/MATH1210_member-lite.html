<h4> 1. What is "membership"? </h4>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Venn_diagram_gr_la_ru.svg/220px-Venn_diagram_gr_la_ru.svg.png" align="right">
<ul><li>
What does   MEMBERSHIP mean? 
What are some examples of membership?
<br>
And ... What are examples of things that something else can be a member of?
<br> &nbsp
Collections? Groups? Classes? Parties? Lists? Sets? Clubs? Gamuts? Teams?
<br>
Letters A and B are members of the 
`<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet">alphabet</a>' 
(what's that?).
What about J?
What is special about A,E,I,O and U?
<br>
Is there a collection whose members are colours
(red, orange, yellow, green, blue, teal, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors:_A%E2%80%93F">antique white</a>, ...)? 
<br> &nbsp
The `spectrum' perhaps?
Or is there more to it?
<br>
The collection whose members are map grid-reference points in the UK?
<br>
The collection of points in the UK to which these grid-references correspond?

</ul>


<ul>
<li>
We talk about `membership' and `belonging' in life. 
Membership of the club or the gang or the team.
<br>
Being a passport holder. 
Belonging (or not) to the group.
Classes of things, to which certain things belong.
<br>
Sameness and difference within a group. A notion of "shared ownership".
<br>
<li> If a US president says: ``America first.'' - what does it mean?

<br>
<li>
Maths, of course, has its own versions of membership:
<br>
If a number is an odd number then it is not an even number.
<br>
If an animal is a dog then it is not a cat.
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/64/CatDog.jpeg/250px-CatDog.jpeg" align="right">
<br>
Exercise: what does this mean? Discuss!
<br>
<li>
And the dictionary says something is a member of a class if...?
<br>
Sort yourself (if you can) into a group according to the following sequence of
criteria:
<br>
Female/Male;
Young/Old;
Religious/not;
Football fan/not;
Music fan/not;
...
<br>
Discuss!

<li> So, when we have a collection into a whole of definite,
well-distinguished objects, of our perception, or of our thought,
then the objects are MEMBERS of the collection.
<br>
This is essentially the `definition' due to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor">G. Cantor</a>.

<li> Pushing the envelope.

<li> Universes.
</ul>




<h4> 2. Helpful pictures of membership </h4>
<ul>
<li> In our example above, you might have been a member of more than
one class/group/collection. 
<br>
(For example Dr Sturman is a member of the class of humans and a member
of the class of living things. 
What about Napoleon? What about Ginger the cat? What about your lunch?)
<br>
How might we represent this `abstractly'?

<img width="220" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Symmetrical_5-set_Venn_diagram.svg/746px-Symmetrical_5-set_Venn_diagram.svg.png">

<li> Exercise: Can you draw a picture representing 2,3,4,... possibly 
overlapping groups?
<br>
Discuss!

</ul>

<h4> 3. Membership and Maths </h4>
<ul>
<li> What does membership have to do with maths?
Perhaps surprisingly, membership is widely considered to be the _main_ 
idea in the foundation of maths.
<br>
Exercise: Discuss.

<li> Are we all happy with this idea of a collection? Examples:
<br>
The collection of Prof Martin's friends.
<br>
The collection or `set' of living dinosaurs. (How big is this set?...)
<br>
The set that we can list like this:  &nbsp
{A,B,C,D,...,Z}
<br>
{1,2,3,4,5,...,26}
<br>
{1,2,3,4,5,...}
<br>
{a,b,c,d,...,z} (?)
<br>
The set of atoms in your fingernail.
<br>
The set of atoms on Earth.
<br>
The set of atoms in the universe.
<br>

<li> The size of a set.
We say a set is `finite' if we can count all the elements in a finite
(possibly very long) time.
<br>
Examples: The set of Prof Martin's friends.
(This is honestly not an empty set. But let's give a name to the
empty set anyway. Let's call it `O'.)
<br>
The set {1,2,3}. The set {A,B,C}.
The set of all words in the Chambers dictionary that can be spelled out
using just the letters {A,B,C}.
<br>
What about the set of all sequences of letters taken from {A,B,C}?
<br>
(Exercise: What is the biggest finite set you can think of?)
<br>
Exercise: What are two different finite sets of the same size?
<br>
The set of all sets of the same size. Is this a set?! (See later.)

<li> One collection or `set' can have elements in common with another.
<br>
One set can be contained in another.
<br>
The set of positive even numbers is a `subset' of the set of positive whole numbers.
<br>
Suppose we start with the set of positive whole numbers (call it `N'), and throw out 
all the even ones, what is left?
<ul>
<li> Can you do this? How big was the starting set? 
How big is the final set?
How amazing are you?
</ul>

<li> Suppose we start with N and throw out all the multiples of 2 except for 2; 
<br>
then throw out all the (remaining) multiples of 3 except 3 (are there any?); 
<br>
then all the multiples of 4 except 4 
(except that 4 is already gone! but no worries);
<br>
then all the multiples of 5; and so on,...
<br>
What kind of set do we have left?
<br>
It is an interesting set. Let's call it `P'. It is not empty.
<br>
But if I give you a random large number ending in digit 3, 
it is famously hard to tell if this number is in P or not.
E.g. 1689394253713
<br>
This is the basis of most banking and national security encryption!!

<li> Remember O={}, the empty set? Could we have a set of sets? 
A set of subsets of the set {A,B,C,...,Z} for example.
<br>
This set looks like this: {{},{A},{B},...,{Z},{A,B},{A,C},...,{A,B,C},...}
(Discuss.)
<br>
How big is this set?
<br>
How about: {{},{{}},{{{}}},...}?
<br>
Are you starting to see why maths loves membership so much?


</ul>


<h4> 4. When membership goes pearshaped </h4>

<ul>

<li> The set of all sets of size 1. Is this really a set?
<br>
Here are some elements of this `set':
The set of people you know for sure exist,
{1}, {2}, {3}, {A}, {B},
<br>
{{1}},
<br>
...No wait. What happened there?
(Discuss.)
<br>
{{{1}}},
<br>
For each set, the set containing just this set as an element.
<br>
[Cue Twilight Zone theme tune....]
<br>
The set of people who understood that cultural reference.
<br>


</ul>

<h4> 5. Homeworks </h4>
<ul>
<li> How could you describe the Mona Lisa as a set?
<br>
Would you lose anything that way?

<li> How could you describe the Ode to Joy in Beethoven's 9th symphony
as a set?
<br>
And another way?
<br> Would you lose anything, in either approach?

<li> Find out about different kinds of sets of colours. Or musical notes.

</ul>

<!--
When we say that you and I should have the equal rights, we mean that
we should have the same rights. And we should have the same rights because
we are the same in both being human.
<br>
Of course, both being human does not make us exactly the same.
<br>
There are important differences and important similarities.
<br>
<li>
How about me today and me tomorrow... Am I the same person?
I seem to have an idea of self -- a feeling of continuity without change.
<br>
But of course I do change from day to day. Older me might make different
choices from younger me. What does it mean to say that we are the 
same person?
<br>
This (sort of) brings us to the picture of the coffee mug...
<br>
<li>
...Maybe you see why, or maybe not! (Exercise: Discuss!)
<br>
But even if you _do_, there is another question:
What has the coffee mug got to do with maths!!?...
(Apart from the obvious.)
<li>
Well, maths codifies the sense in which stages in the `life' of the 
coffee mug are the same, and in which they are different.
<li>
<li>
Would you like to know more?
