Let's think a little more about Arrow's theorem...
(This is the one that is about ways of converting a collection of
 individual voter rankings of candidates A,B,C,... in an election, to an election
 outcome - a ranking that we may attribute to society collectively.
 The starting point is to say that there are three reasonable requirements for fairness:
  `Unanimity': if every individual prefers A to B then the vote outcome should too;
  IIA: the outcome's ordering just of A and B should not depend on someone changing where they order C, but with no change to the order of A and B;
  AND FINALLY
  No single person should determine the outcome.
 The Theorem says "there is no fair system"!)


1. Does it mean Maths is useful, or not?!



2. How can we ``prove'' something like that Theorem?

Here is a little glimpse...

Recall the theorem:
Any system that obeys unanimity and IIA (Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives) is a `dictatorship'.
(Can you see why this is what the Theorem implies?)

Let's think about a claim that is clearly related:
If every voter ranks candidate A either best or worst, then so does any vote system
obeying the three fairness assumptions.

Let's suppose this is NOT true.

Then there are B,C 
and individual rankings so that the result is B>A>C.

Now adjust the individual rankings so that if person i has 
A top, move C up to second. 

And for each person j with A bottom move C top.

This doesn't change any voter's preference between A,B.
So by IIA the result is still B>A.

And similarly A>C.

But now every individual has C ranked over B. So... by Unanimity, C>B, and hence C>A in the result.
A contradiction!


....OK, that's enough for now.  :-)



3. How could we try to get around it?

Notice that it only applies to systems with more than 2 candidates.
Could we find a way to reduce to a sequence of 2-candidate elections,
and always use a fair system (majority) for those?
