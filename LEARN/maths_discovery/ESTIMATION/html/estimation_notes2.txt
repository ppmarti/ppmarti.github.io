Estimation: 
Initial examples



First, to test out socrative, and to for a first go at 
a question.

- How many children does the queen have?
- How many students in UoL?
- How many people live in the UK? 

Is this "general knowledge", a guess, or an estimate? 
What's the difference?	
Is accuracy crucial?



The above are questions people might *know* the answer to, but:

- How many books in UoL libraries? 
- How many metres of corridor in UoL? 
- How many sweets in the jar? 

These are questions we almost certainly don't know the answer to,
and we need to guess, or ideally, estimate. 



These are also "counting" questions - we might also have questions like:

- How fast, in miles per hour, does:
 - Usain Bolt run? 
 - a jumbo jet fly? 
 - human hair grow? 

- or how far, in kilometres:
 - is Leeds from London? 
 - is Leeds from Sydney? 
 - is Leeds from the Sun? 

- or something like:
 - what's the value of all the art in the world?
 - how long would it take you to read all the books ever written?
 - or listen to all the music ever written?
 - which is likely to be longer?
 - How many people do I know, or know someone who knows?
 - How much money do I need to get to the end of my life?





*** WHY are we doing this? ***

- Activity: [Possibly chaotic exercise: we give out around 30 or so bits of paper with things
like "number of modules offered at Leeds", for you to put in order.]


Techniques:


Good ways to imagine big-ish numbers

(Subitizing - how long does it take to "count" a bunch of things? The
time increases pretty quickly from quite small numbers). 

Things there are around 100 of:

Seats in this lecture theatre;
Number of facebook friends(?);
other examples...

Things there are around 1000 of:

Bricks in a wall?



Things there are around 10,000 of:

Elland Road capacity: ~40,000
Headingley: ~20,000 (either rugby or cricket)
Albert hall: ~5000
O2 Arena: ~20,000
Wembley: ~90,000


Things there around 100,000 of:

The Bible has around 800,000 words
The Hobbit: ~100,000
Harry Potter & Prisoner of Azkaban: ~100,000
Lord of the Rings: ~500,000

Bigger numbers:

Population of Yorkshire: 5,300,000
Population of UK: 65,000,000
Population of world: 7,000,000,000



How many atoms in a grain of sand?
78 000 000 000 000 000 000 

This is getting out of hand!

- Orders of magnitude/scientific notation

10^5 etc - what does it mean?






Fermi's method
--------------

- Classic example of piano tuners in Chicago

Key points:
- only need to estimate things to an order of magnitude - fine to be imprecise
- simplify!
- fewer steps the better, but you might need more
- think about the answer - does it make sense?
- When to round up, when to round down?



Practise questions:

(We can use socrative.)


Why does it work as well as it does? 
(Roughly, random estimate errors cancel out.)
