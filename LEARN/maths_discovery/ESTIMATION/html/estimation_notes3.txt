Initial examples



First, to test out socrative, and to for a first go at 
a question.

- How many children does the queen have?
- How many students in UoL?
- How many people live in the UK? 

Is this "general knowledge", a guess, or an estimate? 
What's the difference?	
Is accuracy crucial?



The above are questions people might *know* the answer to, but:

- How many books in UoL libraries? (~2.8 million)
- How many metres of corridor in UoL? (?)
- How many sweets in the jar? (471)

These are questions we almost certainly don't know the answer to,
and we need to guess, or ideally, estimate. 



These are also "counting" questions - we might also have questions like:

- How fast, in miles per hour, does:
 - Usain Bolt run? (~28 mph)
 - a jumbo jet fly? (550 mph [Boeing 747])
 - human hair grow? (~10^-8 mph)

- or how far, in kilometres:
 - is Leeds from London? (272)
 - is Leeds from Sydney? (16,929)
 - is Leeds from the Sun? (149,600,000)

- or something like:
 - what's the value of all the art in the world?
 - how long would it take you to read all the books ever written?
 - or listen to all the music ever written?
 - which is likely to be longer?
 - How many people do I know, or know someone who knows?
 - How much money do I need to get to the end of my life?



*** WHy are we doing this? ***

- Activity: [Possibly chaotic exercise: give out around 30 or so bits of paper with things
like "number of modules offered at Leeds", for them to put in order, between them]


Techniques:


Good ways to imagine big-ish numbers

(Subitizing - how long does it take to "count" a bunch of things? The
time increases pretty quickly from quite small numbers). 

Things there are around 100 of:

Seats in this lecture theatre;
Number of facebook friends(?);
other examples...

Things there are around 1000 of:

Bricks in a wall?



Things there are around 10,000 of:

Elland Road capacity: ~40,000
Headingley: ~20,000 (either rugby or cricket)
Albert hall: ~5000
O2 Arena: ~20,000
Wembley: ~90,000


Things there around 100,000 of:

The Bible has around 800,000 words
The Hobbit: ~100,000
Harry Potter & Prisoner of Azkaban: ~100,000
Lord of the Rings: ~500,000

Bigger numbers:

Population of Yorkshire: 5,300,000
Population of UK: 65,000,000
Population of world: 7,000,000,000



How many atoms in a grain of sand?
78 000 000 000 000 000 000 

This is getting out of hand!

- Orders of magnitude/scientific notation

10^5 etc - what does it mean?



Fermi's method

- Classic example of piano tuners in Chicago

Key points:
- only need to estimate things to an order of magnitude - fine to be imprecise
- simplify!
- fewer steps the better, but you might need more
- think about the answer - does it make sense?
- When to round up, when to round down?

Practise questions:

http://www.fermiquestions.com/play

use socrative?

Why does it work? (Roughly, estimates cancel out, perhaps give an example)


Importance of all this:

Crowd counting estimates:
