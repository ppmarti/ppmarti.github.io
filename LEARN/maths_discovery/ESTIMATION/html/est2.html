<h2> 1. Rough sizes of things/numbers  </h2>

<p class="pp3">
One good trick is to have in your imagination some examples of differently
numbered things.
<br>
For example, can you think of something familiar that has
100 things? 1000 things? 10,000 things?

<p class="pp3">
Rather than continuing to add zeros here, we might use "scientific notation", 
which just displays the "number of zeros" in a quantity.
<br>
This is especially
useful for huge numbers, like the number of atoms in a grain of sand.
<br>
This
could be written
<br>
80 000 000 000 000 000 000,
<br>
but is perhaps more readable
as
<br>
8x10^19,
<br>
that is, 8 with 19 zeros after it.
<br>
These zeros represent
"orders of magnitude".
</p>

<p class="pp3">
What about units?
<br>
What are good units for measuring things in?
<br>
Some things formally make sense as whole numbers (or `real' numbers).
<br>
Some are measured in funny units (grams, megatons, Sieverts, dollars,...)
