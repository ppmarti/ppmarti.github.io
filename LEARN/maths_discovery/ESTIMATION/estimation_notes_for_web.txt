What's the difference between general knowledge, a guess, and an estimate?

Often we might want an answer to a numerical question - how accurate to
we need to be? Sometimes we can look up the answer, but often questions
are less tangible, and have an unattainable exact answer. Whether it's
to win a jar of sweets, or to see through a dubious headline, it's 
important to be able to estimate with reasonable accuracy and confidence.

One good trick is to have in your imagination some examples of differently
numbered things. For example, can you think of something familiar that has
100 things? 1000 things? 10,000 things?

Rather than continuing to add zeros here, we might use "scientific notation", 
which just displays the "number of zeros" in a quantity. This is especially
useful for huge numbers, like the number of atoms in a grain of sand. This
could be written 80 000 000 000 000 000 000, but is perhaps more readable
as 8x10^19, that is, 8 with 19 zeros after it. These zeros represent
"orders of magnitude".

Enrico Fermi was an Italian nuclear physicist in the first half
of the twentieth century. He was well-known for being excellent
at scientific estimation, and gave his name to the "Fermi method".

The idea is to break an estimation problem up into a combination of 
smaller sub-problems. We make an order of magnitude estimate for each, 
and hope that any errors we make will roughly cancel each other out
when the estimates are combined to give an estimate for the original
problem. This method often produces surprisingly accurate estimates, 
although may need some practice!
