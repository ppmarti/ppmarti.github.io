This is a learning 
resource page for "Discovering Maths".
<br>
It is independent of any particular module or programme. 
<br>
<br>
In particular the <a href="../..">Leeds</a> module 
<a href="http://webprod1.leeds.ac.uk/catalogue/dynmodules.asp?Y=201617&M=MATH-1210">
Math1210 Maths All Around</a> is relevant.

<h4> 1. What is "membership"? </h4>
<ul><li>
Think about  the notion of MEMBERSHIP,
and  how it might connect maths to life...
</ul>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Venn_diagram_gr_la_ru.svg/220px-Venn_diagram_gr_la_ru.svg.png">

<ul>
<li>
We talk about `membership' and `belonging' in life. 
Membership of the club or the gang or the team.
<br>
Being a passport holder. 
Belonging (or not) to the group.
Classes of things, to which certain things belong.
<br>
Sameness and difference within a group. A notion of "shared ownership".
<br>
And these are all very interesting and complex topics. And important.
<br>
<li>
Can maths help us to get a handle on these ideas? 
... Perhaps not! But we might learn something useful about maths
if we give it a try.
<br>
<li>
Maths, of course, has its own versions of membership:
<br>
If a number is an odd number then it is not an even number.
<br>
If an animal is a dog then it is not a cat.
<br>
Exercise: what does this mean? Discuss!
<br>
<li>
And the dictionary says something is a member of a class if...?
<br>
Sort yourself (if you can) into a group according to the following sequence of
criteria:
<br>
Female/Male;
Young/Old;
Religious/not;
Football fan/not;
Music fan/not;
...
<br>
Discuss!

<!--
When we say that you and I should have the equal rights, we mean that
we should have the same rights. And we should have the same rights because
we are the same in both being human.
<br>
Of course, both being human does not make us exactly the same.
<br>
There are important differences and important similarities.
<br>
<li>
How about me today and me tomorrow... Am I the same person?
I seem to have an idea of self -- a feeling of continuity without change.
<br>
But of course I do change from day to day. Older me might make different
choices from younger me. What does it mean to say that we are the 
same person?
<br>
This (sort of) brings us to the picture of the coffee mug...
<br>
<li>
...Maybe you see why, or maybe not! (Exercise: Discuss!)
<br>
But even if you _do_, there is another question:
What has the coffee mug got to do with maths!!?...
(Apart from the obvious.)
<li>
Well, maths codifies the sense in which stages in the `life' of the 
coffee mug are the same, and in which they are different.
<li>
<li>
Would you like to know more?
