<h1>Math3152/5153 Coding Theory Exam FAQ 2018</h1>
<!{{{> <!-- lecture notes -->
<h4> FAQ (Mainly a summary of FAQs and answers from our lectures) </h4>
<ul>

<li> Q: What was that list of hot revision topics for 3153 again?
<br> A: They include:
Cartesian product; Hamming distance; triangle inequality; minimum distance;
ball-packing bound; p(error); code parameters;
finite fields and spaces; linear codes;
dual codes; 
standard array; syndrome decoding; along with some other things we have
discussed. 

<li> Q: Will we  be given solutions for  the past exams?
<br>A: Good question. 
I don't have access to the original indicative solutions in all cases. 
However there are good indicative solutions to a past  exam 
(that is highly representative of our paper) available
from the webpage. 
<br> I will also work through some of the most interesting questions
from 2015 and 2016 in class under 'exam' conditions. This will be an 
exciting test for me (!), but should also result in me producing good
solutions in class, which you can of course copy down.  

<li>  Q: Will we  
need to know for the exam the proofs that you asked us to prove  
ourselves, or will we just be examined on those proofs that are in the  
notes?
<br> A: Good question. In addition to the ones we did in class,
some of the ones I left for you to do as exercises might come up.
(But before you start worrying - it would only be relatively easy ones.
I'll give some verbal indications in class.)
<br>
 You should
also be prepared to answer questions of the form which
 require you to prove the non-existence of a code with
certain given parameters (see Exercise sheets for examples).
<br>
And of course there are a small number of question parts 
in the exam inviting you to 
demonstrate your mastery of the material by going _beyond_ what we
have seen.


<li> Q: Can we have a list of  
proofs that we might be expected to reproduce in the exam?
<br> A:
I will give some verbal indications. (Also see answer above.)



<li> Q: I am hoping and aiming for a nice solid first class mark,
nothing more.
Do I need to read the answer to the  question after this one?
<br> A: Perhaps only if you are curious.  ;-)



<li> Q: I am a super-smart student aiming for a super-high grade.
What extra work should I do?
<br> A: Interesting question. 
We tend to think of the super-high grades (85+ perhaps) as 
reserved for attempts so good that the student is a potential
candidate for a PhD later. (Is that you?)
<br>
If so, then you should keep in mind that such people are held
to a higher standard of mathematical writing - more like a 
professional mathematician writing to inform a client than 
a kid hoping to convince the teacher that they know something
- if they are going to get those last couple of extra marks.
(If that makes sense!?)
So,...
<br>
ALWAYS (ALWAYS) write in sentences.
<br>
To get those last couple of top marks, 
your proofs must read like logical arguments.
<br>
If you look at the indicative answers to past exams, keep in mind that
`proof' is a relative activity (i.e. how much to write depends on 
who you are writing for). In preparing indicative answers the author
might write just enough to help you see your way through a proof.
This would include indications of the key points for which marks
can be given. But it might 
just possibly jump over some of the actual arguments, in cases
where they are straightforward. 
In answering in an exam, you probably need to be more careful,
more thorough,  than 
this. And of course you need to _give_ those arguments explicitly. 
<br>
Actual maths is an act of communication. So try to make sure you
are writing in a way that communicates. (In an exam there is not
much time. It won't be perfect. But for the very top marks, this is
what we are looking for.) 
<br> Do _not_ claim you have proved something when you have not.

<li> Q: Can I invent my own notation in the exam and use it 
without explaining it?
<br>
A: No.

<li> Q: My writing is scruffy. Is that a problem?
<br>
Scruffy? Not a problem. Illegible? Yes, a problem. Find a way to fix it.
<br> Again, maths is partly an act of communication (of truth). 
You could fail to do that by communicating something that is not truth;
or by being illegible.
<br> In Coding Theory, which is literally about communicating 
accurately, it would be highly ironic to fail to do this by making
your own handwriting a very noisy channel!!




<li>
Q: What are the right answers for Problems 2 Q1?!
<br>
A: (a) 2x2x2x2=1, and 3x3x3x3=1, so 1+3=4  (mod.5)
<br> (b) 1x3=3
<br> (c) 1-3=3
<br> (d) 1/3=2

<li> Q: I think there might be a typo in the notes (for example  in
the statement of the theorem relating the dimension of a code to the dimension of the dual code). Is that possible?
<br>
A: Yes it is very possible. Producing a book of notes like this is a big
task, and they never seem to come out perfect. The hope is that enough of it
is right that you can at least spot the inconsistencies 
and see how to fix them.
<br>
(In the case you mention, I confirm that the dual code is a [n,n-k]-code,
not a [n-k,k]-code as the typo in the notes suggests.
Of course both the code and the dual come from the space of codewords of the same length (n), so it must be [n,something]!)

<li> Q: It's all too hard/easy for me. Can you slow down/speed up?
<br> A: Sure, within certain limits. 
Our speed is dictated by the material in the module, which we cover,
and by the fact that the more carefully we go, the deeper our understanding
can be. (I appreciate that deep understanding and passing an exam are
not quite the same, but the former is important.)
Since we have succeeded in covering the material of the module now,
if you want to do more (and faster?) you need to propose some
specific revision questions that you feel you are weak on.
Then we can work (quickly, if need be) through these.

<ul> Selected answers:
<li> 1(a)(iii) d=5
<li> 1(b)(ii) Have bound on M from BP. But also for a linear 3-ary code
M=3^k. So an upper bound on k is given by the largest k so that 
3^k does not exceed the BP bound.
<li> (iii) use the k above.

The lecturer (and material covered) changed in Autumn 2002. Thus the
old exam papers contain some questions which are no longer
covered by the revised syllabus. However, many of the questions are
still relevant.
