<h4> MATH3153/5153 FAQ 2017 </h4>
Q. Can I give in exercise attempts for feedback? 
<br>
A. Yes - any time.
<br>
Q. What will come up in tutorials?
<br>
A. Anything you like from the course. Just let us know what you 
need help with.
<br>
Q. Where are the solutions for sheet X (insert X as appropriate)?
<br>
A. They are made available a few days after the questions become
relevant.
<br>
Q. What is the difference between 3153 and 5153 (apart  from 
the scheduling)?
<br>
A. For a quick answer, compare the syllabi. 
For more details now, have a chat with the lecturer.
 For even more details, please wait until week 5.
<br>
Q. The lectures are too hard (/too easy), what can I do?
<br>
A. Obviously if some people find lectures too hard 
and some find them too easy
(as often happens at the beginning of a module) 
<br>
then we cannot address this by simply making them
harder or easier! If you said "too easy" then please be patient - they will 
get harder.
<br>
If you said "too hard", then please let the lecturer or tutor know
exactly something that you found hard, and we will help via
tutorial support.
