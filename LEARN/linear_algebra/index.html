<h1> Basic Linear Algebra </h1>

This is a learning resource page for Linear Algebra, mainly for Part 2 undergraduates. 
<br>
It is not specific to any module or programme. Check your syllabus.

<h4> Selected Lecture Notes and Other Reading </h4>

The following sets of notes may provide useful support for your studies.
<ul>
<li> Some handy notes on 
<a href="lin2001.pdf"> LINEAR ALGEBRA </a>
<li> One good way to learn more about linear algebra 
(or to learn about it if the formal treatment doesn't suit you!)
is to think about its applications.
There are lots of interesting problems in 
<a href="https://archive.org/stream/manzoor_C/01%20Matrix#page/n83/mode/2up">Economics</a>, 
<a href="https://archive.org/details/highermathematic029159mbp"> Engineering </a>, 
Physics, Finance, Chemistry and so on that are well modelled by a system of simultaneous 
linear differential equations. These are quite easy to solve if we can do
linear algebra! For examples see the textbooks mentioned below.
<li>
Some handy notes on

<a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ra359/courses/X1Algebra/current/AlgebraNotes.pdf">
-->
<a href="AlgebraNotes.pdf">
SETS, COMPLEX NUMBERS,
SEQUENCES AND SERIES, and DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS (provisional version)</a>
(NB, Matrices are not included).
</li>
<!-- <li>
Some notes for more advanced students wishing to make 
<a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ra359/psfiles/a3.pdf">
Algebra THE NEXT STEP (provisional version)
</a>. 
These notes have been used in the past to help students prepare for 
Part 2 Linear Algebra courses. They are not currently being used for this
purpose, and the `Treasure hunt' refered to in the notes is not happening this
year. 
However, you may find some of these notes useful as 
collateral/support  material for Part 1 Algebra!
