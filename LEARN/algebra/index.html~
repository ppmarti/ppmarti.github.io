<h4> Selected Lecture Notes and Other Reading </h4>
A complete set of lecture  notes are presented in class, but the 
following sets of notes may provide a useful base for your studies.
<ul><li>
Some handy notes on 
<a href="AlgebraNotes.pdf">
SETS, COMPLEX NUMBERS,
SEQUENCES AND SERIES, and DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS (provisional version)</a>
- i.e. notes on ALL topics covered in the course except Matrices
(for Matrices, all notes must be taken in class).
</li><li>
Some handy notes on 
<a href="X1AlgRels.pdf"> RELATIONS (provisional version) </a> 
</li><li>
Some notes for more advanced students wishing to make 
<a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ra359/psfiles/a3.pdf">
Algebra THE NEXT STEP (provisional version)
</a>. 
These notes have been used in the past to help X1 students prepare for 
the X2 Linear Algebra course. They are not currently being used for this
purpose, and the `Treasure hunt' refered to in the notes is not happening this
year. 
However, you may find some of these notes very useful as 
collateral/support  material for X1 Algebra!  
</li><li>
Visit Dr Cox's X2 Linear Algebra homepage for some useful notes on matrices (and 
much more besides!).
