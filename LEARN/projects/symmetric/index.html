<h2>  Representation theory of the symmetric group  </h2>
Here we take the general machinery of ring theory and representation theory
and apply it to a specific (infinite but unified) collection of problems.
The symmetric group lies at the heart of the connection between algebra and combinatorics,
and the project also requires the student to make use of this connection. 
The representation theory of the symmetric groups over the complex field is a hard problem,
but is quite well understood and treated in the research literature. It leads, however, to a
number of beautiful open problems.
