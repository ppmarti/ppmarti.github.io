<H1>Paul Martin's Ethical Finance Project Links Page</H1>
The objective is to construct a mathematical model of certain financial tools
(you choose which)
through which ethical considerations about these tools can be
articulated.
<br>
The aim is to 
model accurately enough, so that ethically `preferable' tools can be designed. 
<br> The challenge is to define the ethical considerations tightly enough
that they can be articulated in a mathematical model. This might 
require a good understanding of the (social?) context of each 
ethical component. (Such as can sometimes be found in the 
ethical formulations of Sharia, for example.) 

<h2> Our base model</h2>
An n-commodity marked `with money' (local-universal unit)
<br>
=
point x in n-dimensional vector space (money values of commodities)
<p>
A person
<br>
=
point y in n+m-dimensional vector space (holdings including money,
influence etc)

<p>
QUESTION:
but does it make sense for all commodity prices to go up (or all down)?
(Inflation/deflation//only when dynamics comes in.)

<p>
Wealth of person in market (in money units)
<br>
= (1,x,...)(y_0, y_1, y_2, ...)^t  where y_0 is money.

<p>
Now x = x(t), so wealth is also time dependent.
<p>
QUESTION: does x(t) behave like a Brownian particle with drift in a field?
<P>
y=y(t) by trading^* and by wealth creation and use.
<br>
(* assume all trades use market, so are instantaneously wealth neutral.)
<br>
There is possible lag in applying market at point of trade - but 
probably can neglect this. 
<p>

<ul>
<li> 1. revise linear algebra and vector spaces.
<li> 2. revise elementary particle motion.
<li> 3. analyse financial tool
<li> 4. examine ethical considerations 
<li> 5. 
</ul>
