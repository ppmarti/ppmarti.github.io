<h2>  Diagram algebra/category project  </h2>
A diagram category is a rather beautiful kind of generalisation of 
the idea of a finite group, which arises in Physics. 
<br>
Project themes:
<ul><li>
What are they?
<li>
How could they be explained to a wide audience of clever non-algebraists?
<li>
How can their "pictorial" nature be used in rigorous calculations?
<li> How do they connect with their applications?
<li> ...
</ul>
<br>
Keywords: Doing algebra with pictures

(meanwhile, if you are interested, just ask me!).

<h2> Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials </h2>
The polynomials that we have in mind have a beautiful 
(and in principle relatively simple) iterative construction
which combines many aspects of algebra and Euclidean geometry.
They have applications in algebraic representation theory.

How could they be explained to a wide audience of clever non-algebraists?

How can their "geometrical" nature be used to help visualise them?
<li> How do they connect with their applications? (For example
in the study of "tilting modules" in representation theory.)

<h2>Polynomials of Potts</h2>
The Potts model is a beautifully simple model of a complex many-body
system (such as a bar magnet, or the entire universe).
In statistical mechanical modelling the fundamental mathematical 
object associated to a given model 
is the partition function,
and for the Potts models the partition function is  
a polynomial.

This polynomial is usually so huge that there is nothing you can do 
with it. But sometimes we are very lucky and we can compute some of 
these polynomials.
The next question that arises is:
<br>
what can we learn from them? How can we analyse them?
<br>
For a quick "answer"
-- or rather an intriguing glimpse --
