<h2>  Diagram algebra/category project (Summer) </h2>
A diagram category is a rather beautiful kind of generalisation of 
the idea of a finite group, such as the symmetric group.
Like groups, these algebras  arise in Physics. But while groups
describe the symmetries in Physical systems, diagram categories 
describe the (mathematical) model of the systems themselves.
<br>
An overarching example of a diagram category is the partition category 
described <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~ppmartin/GRAD/pcat-heuristic.html"> here </a>. Just like the symmetric groups have many subgroups,
so the partition category has many subcategories. 
If one puts aside the Physical applications for a moment, then it becomes
a challenging exercise to try to find new subcategories with 
interesting structures.
Many such substructures have been found. But there are certainly many
more still to be discovered!
<br>
Project themes:
<ul><li>
What are they?
<li>
1. How could they be explained to a wide audience of clever non-algebraists?
  <ul><li> Improve the web-site!
    <ul><li> Content 
        <li> Layout <li> Format/Style/devel.environment <li> ...More?
    </ul>
      <li> Other media
  </ul>
<li>
2. How can their "pictorial" nature be used in rigorous calculations?
  <ul><li> Geometry/topology <li> Gram matrices <li> ...
  </ul>
<li> 3. How do they connect with their applications?
<li> 4. Can you find a new one!?
  <ul><li> Monoidal?
  </ul>
<li> 5. Representation theory
</ul>
