<h2> draft FAQ for Knots and entropy project (joint with Rob Sturman)  </h2>
<ul>
<li> Is this Pure or Applied? 
<br>
Answer: up to you! In practice they work
well together, so there is no need to choose. 
<br>
(But you can choose
to focus on one or the other - there are routes through the project
emphasising either.)
<li>
<li> What is the general methodology? 
<br>
Answer: 
For the nominal aim it would be
along the same lines as 
<a href="https://wikis.bris.ac.uk/display/ipshe/Methodology">
the IPSHE project </a>
funded by <a href="http://www.hestem.ac.uk/"> the National HE STEM Programme </a>
<br>
But for a route emphasising Pure maths it might be slightly different... Ask us!

Why does your headphone cable get tangled?
<br>
How might we prevent this with better cable design?
<br> <p>
This is a project about applying maths to solve real world problems.
Real world problems of a certain broad type.
(Not necessarily headphone cable tangles, but perhaps something analogous;
or something related, like how to achieve good washing results 
by a good design for a washing machine ...)
<br><p>
So, the first question is, what kind of challenge are we going to try
to apply maths to?
 -- For definiteness let's think about the cable design problem.
<br>
In which case the _aim_ is to design a better (less tangly) cable. 
<br>
(The project need not actually achieve this aim, but it should try to
take a helpful step in the right direction.)
<br><p>
This challenge is going to start with the problem of understanding _why_ the 
cable tangles.
<br>
And perhaps even before that, the problem of establishing exactly what
it means to say that the cable tangles!
<br>
(It might be a good idea 
for a project student or team working in this area
to begin by getting some quantitative 
information on real cable tangling -- that is, by doing some 
controlled experiments with real cables. 
The exact details of the experiment are not
so important here. 
The idea is just to get a feel for what really 
happens when a cable tangles.)
<br>
<p>
The next question is: how do we apply maths to help us with this challenge?!
<br>
This is the problem of ``mathematical modelling''.
<br>
A good place to look for clues is in the way maths already models
knots and tangles -- in the Theory of Knots and Tangles (which 
already exists!
See e.g. the book 
Introduction to Knot Theory by R H Crowell and R H Fox).
<br>
Then we can see if this existing maths can be adjusted to suit our 
cable modelling problem.
