<h2>  Knots   </h2>
Here we give a formal definition of a mathematical knot sufficient
for the knots project.
(We assume you have done core undergrad maths.)
<p>
See e.g. the book 
Introduction to Knot Theory by R H Crowell and R H Fox.
<a href="http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/crowfox.pdf"> here! </a>

<br>
<p>
Definition:
A subset K of R^3 is a <em>knot </em>
if it is a homeomorphic image of the unit circle S^1 in R^3.

<p>
Are we clear on the various terms here?
<br>
R^d means real d-dimensional space
(in our case real 3d space).
<br>
The unit circle is a certain specific subset of R^2.
<br>
For `homeomorphism' we need to take a step back...
<br>
We assume you know what a metric space (X,d) is.
And a topological space (X,O), where O is the set of all open subsets.
<br>
(See e.g. <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmt6jrp/3224formula1.pdf"> MATH3224 module </a>  or MATH3225 module at Leeds.)
<br>
A map f:X -> Y between topological spaces is <em> continuous </em> if 
the preimage of an open set in Y is open in X.
<br> Map f is a <em> homeomorphism </em> if it is a bijection 
and the inverse is also continuous.  
<br>
...
<br>
Implicit in our definition of a knot is that both R^3 and S^1
are topological spaces.
<br>
Is this clear?
<p>
How does this definition compare with a real knot?
It works quite well (although you certainly have to think about it
-- real knots are tied in open strings, not closed loops;
so the closedness is standing in for some other aspect ...). 
<br>
One issue is that there is scope for some rather unphysical
`infinite' tanglings in our definition. 
We can neatly avoid these by restricting to `polygonal'
knots as follows. 
<p>
Definition: A <em>polygonal </em> knot is one which is the union of finitely many closed straight segments. 
<p>
A polygonal knot is the union of at least 3 segments.
There are infinitely many such triangular knots, but next we will 
organise knots into equivalence classes with respect to a natural topological
equivalence. And all the triangular knots lie in the same 
class
 ...

<h3>Equivalence classes of knots </h3>

<p>
Two knots are <em> equivalent </em> if there is a homeomorphism of R^3 onto itself that takes one onto the other.

<p>
One interesting problem is then to classify knots up to equivalence.
<br>
The class of the natural embedding of the unit circle is called the unknot.
<p>
Are there any other classes?
<br>
How many?
<br>
...

What are mathematical knots and tangles?
That is, what is the formal definition of a mathematical knot?
<li> In what ways are they similar or different to real (static) knots?
<li>
How can they be worked with mathematically?
<li>
How can their "pictorial" representation be used in rigorous calculations?
<li> How do they connect with their applications?
