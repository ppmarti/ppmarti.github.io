<h2>  Knots and entropy project (joint with Rob Sturman)  </h2>
Why does your headphone cable get tangled?
<br>
How might we prevent this with better cable design?
<br> <p>
This is a project about applying maths to solve real world problems.
<br>
Real world problems of a certain broad type.
(Not necessarily headphone cable tangles, but perhaps something analogous;
or something related, like how to achieve good washing results 
by a good design for a washing machine,
or how to minimize the risk of umbilical chord tangling in the womb* ...)
<br><p>
So, the first question is, what kind of challenge are we going to try
to apply maths to?
 -- For definiteness let's think about the cable design problem.
<br>
In which case the _aim_ is to design a better (less tangly) cable. 
<br>
(The project need not actually achieve this aim, but it should try to
take a helpful step in the right direction.)
<br><p>
This challenge is going to start with the problem of understanding _why_ the 
cable tangles.
<br>
And perhaps even before that, the problem of establishing exactly what
it means to say that the cable tangles!
<br>
(It might be a good idea 
for a project student or team working in this area
to begin by getting some quantitative 
information on real cable tangling -- that is, by doing some 
controlled experiments with real cables. 
The exact details of the experiment are not
so important here. 
The idea is just to get a feel for what really 
happens when a cable tangles.)
<br>
<p>
The next question is: how do we apply maths to help us with this challenge?!
<br>
This is the problem of ``mathematical modelling''.
<br>
A good place to look for clues is in the way maths already models
knots and tangles -- in the Theory of Knots and Tangles (which 
already exists!
See e.g. the book 
Introduction to Knot Theory by R H Crowell and R H Fox).
<br>
Then we can see if this existing maths can be adjusted to suit our 
cable modelling problem.
<p>
Next we will need to think about what is happening physically 
(i.e. mechanically) with our cable?
...But let's leave that until we've thought about how to model
the cable `statically'.

<p>
Project themes:
<ul><li>
What are mathematical knots and tangles?
That is, what is the formal definition of a mathematical knot?
<li> In what ways are they similar or different to real (static) knots?
<li>
How can they be worked with mathematically?
<li>
How can their "pictorial" representation be used in rigorous calculations?
<li> How do they connect with their applications?
<li> What are the dynamics, the mechanics, of real knots?
How can _these_ be modelled?
<li> What is entropy and how can it help us?
<li> ...
</ul>
<br>
Keywords: 
knots, tangles, energy and entropy

* The umbilical chord tangling problem has already been studied in one of our excellent 
projects from 2015/16, having been proposed as an example by the student herself.
