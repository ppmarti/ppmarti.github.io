<h1> Some postgrad rules of thumb </h1>

IN PREPARATION
<p>
Here will (eventually) come some general "rules" for writing up your work.
<p>
If you are my student, please try not to give me anything to read without first
checking here. Thanks!
</p>

	<ul>
	<li> R1 <b>compare and contrast:</b> 
   when you are writing something up, always find a way to put what you are doing in some kind of context.
Give <em> something </em> to compare it with. 
<li> R2 <b>references: </b>
   the more the better. 
<li> R3 <b>references: </b> 
   try to give the original reference. If you give a reference that is not the original, say perhaps "see for example [6]"
(here you are showing that it is not the unique reference on the topic).
<li> R4 <b>think of the reader:</b>
   if you are writing a long unit of work, give a preliminary component 
introducing it and saying what the reader will get out of it.
This applies to whole documents, and also to large units within documents. 
<li> R5 <b>think of the reader:</b>
Try to make your document self-contained. This can be done by referencing
other (accessible) documents which contain the 
prerequisites, for example. 
<li> R6 think of the reader:
There is no such thing as an informal document. If you are giving it 
to someone else (e.g. me or a co-supervisor) then give it due care.
For example, if acknowledgements are appropriate, include them.
<li> R7 <b>it is mathematics: </b>
avoid subjectivity; avoid non-proofs (proof by bullying;
proof by just wanting it to be true; etc etc).
Respect the structures of mathematical writing (and if you are unsure, ask). 

</ul>
