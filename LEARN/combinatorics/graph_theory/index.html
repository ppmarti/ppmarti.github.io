<h1> Learning resources: Graph theory and combinatorics </h1>

This page can help support courses such as the Leeds modules MATH3110 and
MATH3143. 
<br>
Content to follow!

  Here is what someone (not me) wrote when asked to summarize Graph Theory in the context of an undergraduate module:
  <br> <p>
  Graph theory is one of the primary subjects in discrete mathematics.  It arises wherever networks (such as computer networks and transportation networks) are found,
<br>
and it has applications to fields diverse as chemistry, computing, linguistics, navigation, and more.
<br> 
More generally, combinatorics concerns finding patterns in discrete mathematical structures, often with the goal of counting the occurrences of such patterns.
<br> 
This module provides a foundation in graph theory and combinatorics.
  </p>

  I think I would re-word it slightly:
<p>
  Graph theory can be thought of as a part of the field of discrete mathematics.
  <br>
  (Discrete maths is the part of maths that aims to empower the scholar without relying on a deep understanding of the real line.
<br>
Or to put it another way, it is the study of systems that, as sets,
can be assigned a first element and such that any element can be reached by counting - unlike the real line, but like the natural numbers.)
<br>
Graph theory is the part of discrete maths where systems can be studied by studying not just their elements, but relationships between elements in groupings - typically pairs
<br>
(and relationships in larger groupings by extension from pair-relationships). 
<br>
  Graph theory arises wherever networks (such as synapses, crystal lattices, social networks, computer networks and transportation networks) are found.
<br>
It has applications to fields such as social science, chemistry, physics, biology, computing, linguistics, navigation, engineering, and many more.
<br> 
<!-- More generally, -->
Combinatorics
more generally
concerns finding patterns in,
and hence understanding,
systems that are well-modelled by 
discrete mathematical structures.
<br> 
This is often with the goal of counting the occurrences of such patterns.
</p>

Some possible indicative learning outcomes for such a module:
<p>
  On successful completion of the module students will have demonstrated the following learning outcomes relevant to the subject:
  <br>
  1. understand the concepts of graph, tree, and partial order;
<br>
  2. describe the basic properties of a given graph;
<br>
3. find spanning trees, matchings, covers, special cycles and trails, homogeneous sets, etc. in a given graph;
<br>
4. understand the statements of some representative key theorems in graph theory and combinatorics (such as the theorems sometimes known as Hall's theorem, Menger's theorem, Ramsey's theorem, and Dilworth's theorem);
<br>
5. understand basic proof techniques in graph theory and combinatorics;
<br>
6. make basic graph-theoretic and combinatorial arguments;
<br>
7. articulate the relations among the  theorems discussed;
<br> 
8. derive simple consequences of the  theorems discussed.
