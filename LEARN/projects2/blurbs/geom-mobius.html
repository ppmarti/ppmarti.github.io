Geometry of Mobius Transformations

  Linear-fractional (Moebius) transformations generate a rich and beautiful
  geometry on the complex plane. They are linked to numerous important
  topics, which are suitable for a detailed separate study:

  1. Non-Euclidean geometry on the Lobachevsky half-plane and Poincare
  disk.

  2. Continuous fractions and best approximations.

  3. Transformations of analytic functions.

  4. Hypercomplex numbers.

  5. Discrete groups and geometries.
