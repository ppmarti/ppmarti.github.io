<H2>Operators and invariant subspaces</H2>
An invariant subspace M for a bounded linear operator (linear mapping) T on a
complex Hilbert space is a closed linear subspace such that Tx is in M whenever x is in M.
In finite dimensions, operators always have eigenvectors, and these span invariant 
subspaces, but it is an old unsolved problem whether operators on infinite-dimensional spaces
have invariant subspaces. This project will investigate what is known, both for
specific operators and in general.
