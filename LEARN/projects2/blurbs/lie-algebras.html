Lie algebras are key objects in many areas of modern mathematics and theoretical physics.
The aim of a 3MM project would be basic structure and classification theorem (including root systems); roughly corresponding to the first 4 chapters of Humphrey's book.
For a 4MM project some representation theory would be included.

<p>
Prerequisites:
A thorough understanding of level 2 linear algebra.
