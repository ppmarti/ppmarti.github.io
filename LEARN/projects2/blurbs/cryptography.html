Codes are as old, or even older than mathematics.  But the recent past has 
seen great advances in encryption, particularly with so-called public key 
encryption methods.  The most famous of these, the RSA method, is simple 
enough to be explainable to schoolchildren, but relies on Euler's extension 
of a result of Fermat's, and depends on the difficulty of factorizing into 
primes for its efficacy.
