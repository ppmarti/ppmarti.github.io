<H2> Algebra/Discrete Mathematics</H2>
This abstract covers a range of possible topics in discrete mathematics,
with specific topic details to be agreed with the supervisor.
<br>
The _paradigm_ is provided by  
the Page rank algorithm (the google algorithm
for determining the `importance' of a web page).
This algorithm uses a number of techniques from graph theory, 
and matrix analysis (such as the Perron-Frobenius Theorem).
The project (in this specific case) 
would be to explain the workings of the
algorithm, by explaining the underlying Mathematics. 
In other cases the aim would be to take an analogous application and
again explain its Discrete Mathematical underpinnings.
