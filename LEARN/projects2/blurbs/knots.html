<H2>Knot Theory</H2>

A knot is a closed, non-self-intersecting curve in 3-space. 
The main problem is to determine whether a given curve can
be deformed into a planar circle, the "unknot". This problem remains
an active focus of research, and is, so far, unresolved. It
can be approached purely combinatorially: 
a polynomial can be assigned to
a knot in such a way
that if 2 knots have different polynomials then it is not possible
to 
deform one knot into the other. 
However,
 to really appreciate the subject there is a significant topological angle 
which can be explored in a longer project.
