<H2>Nim type Games</H2>

The basic theory of Nim type games is quite straightforward  and
requires nothing more than addition modulo 2. The task will be to
explain the general theory and then to work out the details for some
particular games. This project may involve quite a bit of work, but
doesn't use any sophisticated 
Mathematics.
