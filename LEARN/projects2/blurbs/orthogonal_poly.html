<H2>Orthogonal and q-orthogonal polynomials</H2>
Dealing with vectors is easy if we have a nice basis to represent
  them. Many spaces of functions can be naturally viewed as vector
space
  thus raising a question about suitable bases. Such bases are oftenly
  provided by families of orthogonal polynomials which have many
  remarkable properties themselves.
