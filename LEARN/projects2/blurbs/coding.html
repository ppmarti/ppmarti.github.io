<H2>Coding Theory</H2>

When digital data are transmitted down a noisy channel (e.g. e-mail down
a telephone wire), some of the digits will be corrupted at random, so that
the data received are not precisely the same as those transmitted. This
is potentially disastrous, so various methods have been designed to
encode data so that, even if (reasonably mild) corruption occurs in
transmission, the correct message can be reconstructed. The basic idea
is to split the data into packets with extra "check digits"
attached which allow the receiving device to check for errors and either
correct them, or seek re-transmission. Coding Theory concerns the 
construction and analysis of these encoding methods. Mathematically it
relies primarily on linear algebra over finite fields, so it would
be helpful (but not essential) to have taken
MATH 2032 Rings, Polynomials and Fields.
