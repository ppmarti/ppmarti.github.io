Zorn's Lemma at Work
</H2>

Zorn's Lemma (ZL), an equivalent of the Axiom of Choice, is often used to
give in full generality an existence proof for a certain mathematical
object. 
<br>
For example, to prove that an arbitrary vector space has a basis
one needs to use ZL unless the vector space under consideration is
finitely generated. 
<br>
This project's objective is to study a selection of
typical applications of ZL in 
<br>
linear algebra (see above), 
<br>
group theory
(maximal p-subgroups), 
<br>
field theory (transcendence bases, algebraic
closures), 
<br>
commutative algebra (maximal submodules, minimal prime ideals).

<p>
Uses of ZL within other parts of pure mathematics may also be considered.

 Theory and Metric Spaces", which can be found e.g. in Section 2.3, on page
