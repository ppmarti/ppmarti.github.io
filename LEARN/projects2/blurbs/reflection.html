<H2>Reflection groups</H2>

<p>Modern pure mathematics extensively uses the classification of
simple Lie algebras by roots systems and Dynkin diagrams.
A gentler introduction to these diagrams comes from the 
classification of finite reflection groups, that is, finite subgroups
of the group of orthogonal transformations of a Euclidean vector 
space generated by a set of reflections. For a 3MB project, the
aim would be to go through the classification of these groups.
For a 4MM project there are various ways it could be augmented,
for example with Gabriel's theorem on representations of
directed graphs.</p>

Prerequisites: <BR>
A thorough understanding of level 1 group theory and level 2 
linear algebra. The level 3 module on groups and symmetry, 
perhaps taken concurrently, would also be an advantage.</p>
