<H2>Complex and hypercomplex numbers</H2>

 Complex numbers proved to be a useful extension of real numbers in
many
  questions of algebra, analysis and geometry. There are many other
  extensions: dual numbers, double numbers, quaternions, octonions and
  Clifford algebras. All of them have many interesting properties and
  provide new insights to many mathematical problems.
