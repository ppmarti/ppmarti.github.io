<H2>Transformation Geometry</H2>

<p> Felix Klein viewed Geometry as the study of properties invariant under
a group of transformations on a space. From this viewpoint two-dimensional
Euclidean geometry is the study of isometries of the plane. Changing
the group of transformations leads to other interesting and useful
geometries: affine, projective, spherical, hyperbolic and Minkowskian
(this last being the natural geometry of spacetime in Einstein's
special relativity). </p>

<p>Prerequisites: Level 2 linear algebra (MATH 2200, MATH 2080, or
equivalent), and MATH 1022 Introductory Group Theory.</p>
