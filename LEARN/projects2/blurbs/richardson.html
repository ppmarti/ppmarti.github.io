<H2>Richardson's Theorem</H2>

<p>Some functions given by elementary formulas have indefinite integrals
which are also given by elementary formulas and some not. For example
the integral of xexp(-x^2) is (1/2)exp(-x^2)+c  but there is no
elementary formula which gives the integral of exp(-x^2). This leads to
the question as to whether there is an algorithm to decide, given an
elementary formula A(x) whether or not there is an elementary formula
B(x) such that the integral of A(x) is B(x).</p>

<p>Of course, to make this precise, we need to give a careful definition
of what we 
mean by an elementary formula. In 1968, using an appropriate
definition, Daniel Richardson proved  that no such algorithm exists.
The aim of the project is to write an account of Richardson's Theorem
and possibly more recent work. A slightly updated version of
Richardson's proof depends on  Matiasevich's solution of Hilbert's
Tenth Problem.   All you need to know is the result which is quite easy
to understand even though the proof is intricate. The techniques used
by Richardson to derive his theorem from Matiasevich's result involve
relatively straightforward ideas from Real Analysis.</p>
