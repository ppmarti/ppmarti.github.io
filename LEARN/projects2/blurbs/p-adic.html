<H2>The p-adic numbers</H2>

The real numbers are obtained from the rationa numbers by `completing', i.e. adding limits of 
Cauchy sequences, with respect to 
Cauchy sequences.  For any prime p, there is another `metric' or distance on the rational numbers. By completing with
 respect to this, one obtains the field Q_p of p-adic numbers. This has 
strange properties: for example, all 
triangles are isosceles. The project could take various directions, for example the Hasse principle, that a quadratic form 
over Q has a rational solution if and only if it has a solution in the reals and in all fields Q. 
Another direction for the project would be to develop the general theory of valued fields.
