<H2>Frieze Patterns of Integers</H2>
<p>A frieze pattern is an infinitely long strip containing a repeating
pattern. It is known that there are 7 types of symmetry amongst
such patterns. Coxeter and Conway consider the notion of a frieze
pattern of integers, in which integers are repeated instead of patterns.
A frieze pattern of integers contains several rows of integers subject
to certain relations, and Coxeter and Conway give a classification of
frieze patterns in terms of triangulations of polygons.</p>

<p>The project will involve studying frieze patterns and their relationship
with triangulations of polygons. There are also a number
of related areas for possible study, including the geometric meaning of
the entries of a frieze pattern and a determinantal relation, additive
frieze patterns, algebraic study of frieze patterns, and the links with
cluster algebras.</p>

<p>This project is primarily combinatorial with links with algebra.</p>
