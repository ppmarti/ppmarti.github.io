<H2>Fractal Geometry</H2>

This could develop in several directions:<BR><BR>
(i) Study of Hausdorff dimension and sets of fractional
dimension.<BR>
(ii) Iteration of complex functions, Julia sets, Fatou sets, Mandelbrot
set.<BR>
(iii) Applications in Number Theory (continued fracions, Diophantine
approximation etc.).<BR><BR>
(i) and (iii) are more sutibale at 4MM level, while (ii) would work
at 3MM or 4MM level.
