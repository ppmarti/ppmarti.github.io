<H2>Combinatorial enumeration</H2>

<p>There are many cases when we need to count number of different
  possibilities. The basic example is the question "How many
  ways to pick up k elements out of the set of n
  different objects?" The answer is provided by the famous binomial
  coefficients C(k,n) which persistently reappear in many other
  questions. For less trivial counting of graphs, tableaux, etc.
various general
  techniques were developed, e.g. generating functions. </p>

 <p> This project deals with such enumerations and general properties of
  the numbers obtained.</p>
