<H2>Cluster algebras</H2>

<p>A cluster algebra is a certain kind of commutative algebra
contained in the field F of quotients of polynomials in n
variables x1,x2,...,xn. The definition is combinatorial and
(in the simplest case) relies on an initial choice of a
directed graph. This graph is then modified via a so-called
"mutation" process which determines generators for the algebra.</p>

<p>Cluster algebras first arose in the theory of the dual canonical
basis of the quantized enveloping algebra, a central object in
Lie theory. Although they have an elementary definition, they have
good properties and links with many other fields, including the
representation theory of quivers, finite dimensional algebras,
Riemannian surfaces and combinatorics.</p>

<p>The cluster algebras of finite type have a particularly beautiful
structure, with a close connection to root systems (finite
subsets of R^n used to define groups generated by reflections)
and their combinatorics. The main initial aim of the project is to
describe the cluster algebras of finite type. There is scope for
development in a variety of directions, such as the more
combinatorial side of cluster algebras or the representation theoretic
side.</p>

<p>
The project is available for the modules MATH 3082, MATH 3083 and
MATH 5082M.
A student taking this project must have passed MATH 1022 Introductory
Group Theory, MATH 2032 Rings, Polynomials and Fields and
MATH 2080 Further Linear Algebra, and either have passed or be taking
MATH 3071 Groups and Symmetry.
