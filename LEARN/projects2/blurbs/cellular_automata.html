<H2>Cellular Automata</H2>

A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one
of a
finite number of states. These evolve at times t=1,2,3,... according to
specific rules. The most famous example is probably Conway's game of
Life.
For a good non-mathematical introduction to this, take a look at the
Wikipedia article on the Internet. Such a project would involve working
through some of the mathematical work of Wolfram and other authors,
although there are no prerequisites beyond second year pure
mathematics.
