<H2>Morse Theory</H2>

Morse theory concerns the study of critical points of a 
differentiable function. These generalise the maxima, minima and saddle
points of 
a real valued function of 2 variables. In the more general case the
domain of 
the function is a manifold, which is a higher dimensional version of a
surface.
