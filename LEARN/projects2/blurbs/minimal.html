<H2>Minimal surfaces</H2>

<p> A soap film stretched between wire hoops will naturally arrange itself
to have the smallest surface area possible. Surfaces of this type are
called "minimal". They have interesting curvature properties, and links
with complex analysis. The aim of this project would be to use the
standard techniques of differential geometry and the calculus of variations
to study the properties of minimal surfaces.
Having taken MATH 2051 Geometry of Curves and Surfaces would
be useful, but not absolutely essential.</p>
