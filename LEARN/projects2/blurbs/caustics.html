<H2>Caustics</H2>

<p>Caustics occur throughout the natural world. You can see one on
the surface of a coffee cup (you'll need a single light source
and milk in your coffee); it is the curve of bright light.
Usually the curve has cusp on it, that is a sharp point. The
patterns of light you can see at the bottom of a swimming pool
are also caustics.</p>

<p>This assignment focuses on the geometry of these interesting
curves and in particular what happens when we move the mirrored
surface that produces them.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: MATH2051 Geometry of Curves and Surfaces.</p>
