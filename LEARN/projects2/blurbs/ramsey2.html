<H2>Ramsey theory and additive combinatorics</H2>

<p>Ramsey theory is, loosely, the study of how structure can
arise in disordered mathematical systems.  The classical Ramsey theory
is a generalisation of the observation that at a party, if you choose
six people at random, then either three people will know each other or
three will be mutual strangers.  A 3rd year project might look at
graph theory, at Ramsey's theorem and its immediate generalisation, at
the Van der Waerden and Hales-Jewitt theorems.  Further directions
would be to look at the elegant dynamical systems proofs, and/or to
investigate the more recent work of Gowers, Green and Tao.  4th year
students might also look at the measure-theoretic issues around
Szemeredi's theorem and Hindman's theorem, and Furstenburg's proof of
them.
