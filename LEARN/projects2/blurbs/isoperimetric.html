<H2>The 2-dimensional isoperimetric inequality - an elementary proof</H2>

<p>The isoperimetric inequality asserts that under all given closed curves
of a fixed lenght in the plane, the enclosed region has maximal area if
and only if the closed curve is actually a circle. There is a nice
and short proof of this using only some basic facts about Fourier
series.</p>

<p>The project has two steps:<BR>
I. Proof of Leibniz' sector formula; this is elementary analysis.<BR>
II. Proof of the isoperimetric inequality.
