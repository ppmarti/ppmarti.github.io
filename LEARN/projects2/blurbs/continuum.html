<H2>The size of the real line</H2>

<p>It is easy to see that the rational numbers are countable, and a
lovely, short  proof of Cantor  shows that the real numbers are not
countable.  This led Cantor to ask if the "infinite size" of the real
line is "one bigger than that of the rational numbers".  The first
part of the project is to understand what this means, and to express
it clearly in mathematical terms.</p>

<p>The "answer" is one of the most famous results in mathematics (and
maybe philosophy) of the 20th century: it can be proved that this
question cannot be answered.  The second part of the project is to
understand what this means, and to explain it well.</p>

<p>The project needs some  knowledge of the real numbers, as covered in
2011 = Real analysis 2, for example.  It also needs a little
background in logic, as covered in 2040, for example; the module 3123 
on Set theory would be very helpful.</p> 

<p>There are many popular accounts of this topic.</p>

<p>For details on the borders of analysis and logic, see J.K. Truss, 
Foundations of Mathematical Analysis, OUP, 1997.</p>

<p>The  proof of the "independence of the continuum hypothesis" is
given in the book "An introduction to independence for analysists",
H.G. Dales and W.H. Woodin, CUP.  The project does not require a full
account of this proof (or a treatment of "forcing"), but should 
conclude with some account of how such a proof could work. </p>
