<H2>Ramsey Theory</H2>

This is really a topic in combinatorics, but has connections to logic (e.g. set theory), number theory, and 
other subjects. An easy (infinitary) version of the theorem says that any infinite graph contains either an infinite
 set of vertices 
any two of which are joined by an edge, or an infinite set of vertices no two of which are joined by an edge. There are 
many subtle variants of this: working with different infinite cardinals, 
statements about `monochromatic' arithmetic progressions for colourings of natural numbers, calculation of
 bounds for finite versions of Ramsey's Theorem, versions for vector space sover finite fields, 
connections to Goedel's incompleteness.
