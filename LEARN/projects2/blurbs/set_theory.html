<H2>Advanced Set Theory</H2>


<p>This project is only suitable for the fourth year 35 credit
assignment,
and in particular for students who have already taken the set theory
course in
their third year.</p>
    <p> Moving on from what was covered in that course, the project may
include
an account of G\"odel's proof of the relative consistency of the
generalized
continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice, Cohen's method of
forcing, and an account of some of what is known about Suslin trees.</p>
    <p> It would also be possible to give an account of the basics of
large
cardinals, for instance definition and basic properties of measurable
cardinals. </p>
