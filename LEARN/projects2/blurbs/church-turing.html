<H2>The Church-Turing Thesis</H2>
<p>


This project requires a basic knowledge of computability theory, such as derivable from MATH3163: Computability and Unsolvability, or the book 'Computability Theory' by S. Barry Cooper. It will appeal to those interested in general questions of what is computable, and in issues of computability in the physical world. The student will need an ability to think independently and grapple with philosophical questions. The student should describe various computational models, and discuss the potential for computation beyond what these models are thought to achieve.
