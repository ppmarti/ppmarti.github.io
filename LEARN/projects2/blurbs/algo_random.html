<p>This project requires a basic knowledge of computability theory, such as derivable from MATH3163: Computability and Unsolvability, or the book 'Computability Theory' by S. Barry Cooper. Building on this, the student should give a basic introduction to the theory of random real numbers, describing the various approaches and motivations, and go on to focus on a selection of results/more advanced topics in the area.

<p>Prerequisites: MATH 3163 Computability and Unsolvability
