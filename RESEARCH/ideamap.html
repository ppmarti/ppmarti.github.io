<h2>Draft group research idea mapper.</h2>

Drag the vertices around to generate fresh ideas.
&nbsp Please screen-grab and send to me arrangements that you find inspiring!
<br>
Contact me to add vertices or edges.
&nbsp 
<br>
The idea is that the intersection of [PhD students] with [people having PPM as co-supervisor] 
will be a subset of vertices; 
<br>
and some other vertices will be research areas.

<br>
Caveats: The ``group'' for which this maps ideas is undefined!
<br>
The selection of vertices is not entirely logical; and the role of Game of Thrones houses is unclear!
<br>
The code is housed on github and uses (nice but random) proprietary widgets.
<br>
The graph embedding resets to a random initial one at each page refresh.
