Combinatorial Representation Theory: Algebra and its interfaces with Geometry, Topology and Combinatorics. 


Version for presentation at grant app surgery:

1. Programme Grants  
 A. provide flexible funding to world-leading research groups 
 B. to address significant major research challenges. 
 C. support world leading researchers, 
  bringing together best teams to undertake a variety of activities 
 D. ...focusing on one strategic research theme. 
 E. can be awarded for up to a six year duration. 
 F. interdisciplinary and collaborative 
  but can address key challenges in a single discipline. 
 G. seen by EPSRC as critical mass investments covering phys science portfolio 
  benefit UK research through the concentration of high performing talent. 
 H. not just large grants but must be strategic in nature. 
  Likely require expertise of number of internationally recognised scientists.
