Disclaimer:
There is no support available for the tilting animation software here. 
It works on at least one platform, and includes the source. YMMV.
<p>
We are not major players in the tilting module world (see rather
[Donkin] and references therein),
but our work lends itself very well to online viewing. 
And thus to having a homepage. (If you, a major player, would like to
be linked (or for us to house your online contribution) it would be
great - let us know.)
<p>
We have a reasonably fast implementation of [Soergel]'s procedure for
computing the standard module content of tilting modules. This
implementation generates vast amounts of such data.
<br>
By virtue of the alcove geometric labelling scheme for standard module
weights this data is geometric. 
<br>
All else being equal, a good way to explore this geometrical data is
to apply alcove geometry to a virtual reality (typically 3D in our
examples). 
<br>
We animate our viewing of individual tilting modules, and the
iterative procedure. 
We do the former so that we may explore the `shape' of the tilting
module in its geometric setting; we do the latter to help search for
patterns of various kinds in the evolution of tilting modules as the
`label' alcove moves away from the fundamental alcove.

Requirements: <br>
To view some `films' of animated tilting modules you need only visit
the <a href="library.html">library</a> 
(under construction, but see 
<a href="lib/trub3x.gif">this</a> or 
<a href="http://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~sg387/giffiles/trub3x.gif">this</a>).
<br>
To explore the alcove world in which tilting modules live you need 
<a href="http://www.geomview.org/">geomview</a>. 
<br>
To create your own using our `tilt' package 
(Copyright (C) 2000 Paul Martin and Dave Woodcock)
you need a reasonably complete linux, gcc, perl etc.
(see the tarball for details).
<p>
Download: <br>
<ul>
<li>
Its all in the <a href="TILT-0.6.3.tgz">tarball (FC6/7, gcc-4 tested)</a>. 
Unpack and follow the instructions. <br>
-- this new version compiles in particular under Fedora Cores 6 and 7
<br>
(including: fixes to conform to gcc4 standards compliance and 
some new behaviour in perl installations;
<br>
AND a nice new G2 schematum!).
<br>
<li> I will shortly also release a binary version that should 
simply run out-of-the-box on suitable platforms 
(with geomview etc).
<li>
Previous <a href="TILT-0.6.1.tgz">version (rh9, gcc-3.2)</a>. 
<li>
Older <a href="TILT-0.5.tgz">version (rh9, gcc-3.2)</a>. 
</ul>
<p>
INSTALL: <br>
Assuming you have all the gear, 
it is probably enough to go into the tilt/ directory and do
<br> ./configure --prefix=WRITE_THE_DIR_NAME_HERE
<br> make bootstrap
<br> make all
<br> ./tilt
<br> But see the READMEs too. 
<p>
CONFIGURATION: <br>
The easiest level of configuration is to use or construct
a type-specific config file called a schematum. <br>
Examples here:
 <a href="schemata/index.html"> schemata etc</a>, 
including user contributed examples.

Notes: <br>
Getting tilt to compile under gcc-3.2 required some massaging
cf. the previous version. We havn't yet eliminated all the C++ ISO
non-conforming warnings etc.. It's not compliant, but they're only
warnings.
