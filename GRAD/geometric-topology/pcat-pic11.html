%\subsection{One or two bits of geometric topology}
Let $T$ be a topological space and $S$ a subset. Then 
write $cl(S)$ for the closure of $S$ and 
write $fr(S) = cl(S) \cap cl(T-S)$.
<br>
Recall that a <em>polyhedron</em> is the underlying set of a Euclidean complex.
<br>
<b>Theorem.</b>  Let $P$ be a polygon (a polyhedron that is the 
homeomorphic image of a circle) in $\R^2$. 
Then $\R^2 - P$ has two components. 
<br>
<b>Theorem </b> (Jordan curve theorem). Let $P$ be the homeomorphic image of a 
circle in $\R^2$. Then $\R^2 - P$ has two components;
and 
for each component $S$, say, 
$P=fr(S)$. 
<p>
These are statements of the `obvious' when one sketches examples,
but they are none-the-less central to some of what follows. 
<p>
By a <em>  polygonal arc </em> in $\R^3$ we mean 
a homeomorphic image of the unit interval in $\R^3$ that is the union of 
finitely many finite straight-line segments.
Such an arc is <em> regular </em> if it is regular in the usual 
knot theory sense of a  polygonal knot in regular position 
with respect to canonical projection [Crowell-Fox]
(with the arc endpoints in particular regarded as vertices).
<p>
A pair of polygonal arcs is regular if they may be completed to a
regular polygonal arc (possibly by identifying arc endpoint vertices).
A finite collection of polygonal arcs is regular if they are pairwise regular
and no point in $\R^2$ belongs to the projection image of the 
interior of more than two arcs. 
<p>
A collection of polygonal arcs is an <em>embedding of a graph</em> 
$g=(V,E,f)$
in $\R^3$ 
<!--
if there is a set of points in $\R^3$ in bijection with $V$;
-->
if 
 no two arcs meet except possibly at endpoints;
and 
there is 
a bijection $\Sigma$ from $E$ to the collection of arcs, 
and 
an injective map $\Sigma : V \rightarrow \R^3$;
<!-- and the collection of arcs is in bijection with $E$ 
-->
such that the endpoints of $\Sigma(e)$ are the images of 
the corresponding vertex set $f(e)$.
An embedding is regular if the collection is regular. 
<p> 
A <em> polygonal line </em> is a subset of $\R^2$ that may be realised as  
the projection into $\R^2$ of a regular polygonal arc (i.e. of  
part of a polygonal knot in regular position).  
<!-- in the usual knot theory 
sense (as for example in [Crowell-Fox]). 
-->
A pair of polygonal lines is regular if they may be completed to a
polygonal line (possibly by identifying arc endpoint vertices).
A finite collection of polygonal lines is regular if they are pairwise regular
and no point in $\R^2$ belongs to the interior of more than two lines.
