\section{Representation theory}

Fix a field $k$ and an element $\delta \in k$.
This fixes a partition category $P$ 
and, for each $n$, 
the partition algebra $P_n$ as the $n$-th End-set $P(n,n)$ in $P$. 
<br>
Write $\circc$ for the monoidal composition in $P$, given by 
side-by-side (as opposed to vertical) composition of partition diagrams.
<br>
Write $1_n$ for the identity element in $P(n,n)$. 
<br>
\subsection{Notations for set partitions}

Write $P^{\circ}(n,m)$ for the basis of 
hom-set $P(n,m)$
consisting of set partitions (of the set consisting of a row of $n$
and a row of $m$ `vertices', labelled $1,2,...,n$ and $1',2',...,m'$
respectively). 
<br>
Write ${\pbase}^l (n,m)$ for the subset of ${\pbase} (n,m)$ consisting of
partitions with $l$ propagating parts. 
<br>
Note that in $p \in {\pbase}^l (n,l)$ each primed vertex lies in a distinct 
propagating part.  
<br>
Fix a partition $p$ in ${\pbase} (n,m)$. 
Each propagating part has a lowest numbered vertext
from $1,2,...,n$ and a lowest numbered vertex from $1',2',...,m'$. 
<br>
One could draw a picture for $p$ in which the only lines drawn between the unprimed
and the primed side correspond to propagating parts, 
and are drawn between lowest-numbered
unprimed vertex and lowest-numbered primed vertex in each case.
<br> 
The `low-shell' of $p$ is the partition obtained by replacing each propagating part
by a part containing just the two lowest numbered elements, with all other elements
being singletons.
We say two propagating parts are low-non-crossing
if their image in the low-shell is non-crossing in the obvious sense. 
We say $p$ is low-non-crossing if each pair of propagating parts is
low-non-crossing.
For example $1_n$ is (equal to its low-shell and) low-non-crossing.

Note that $p$ can be low-non-crossing without being a plane partition.

\begin{proposition}
Every $p \in {\pbase}^l (n,m)$ 
can be expressed in the form $p_L * p_R$ where 
$p_L \in {\pbase}^l (n,l)$ and $p_R \in {\pbase}^l (l,m)$. 
\end{proposition}

Proof: use the remarks about pictures above. 
 

<p>
Let ${\pbase}^{=l}(n,m)$ denote the subset of ${\pbase}^l (n,m)$
consisting of low-non-crossing elements.

\begin{proposition}
Every $p \in {\pbase}^{l} (n,l)$
can be expressed in the form $p_L * p_R$ where
$p_L \in {\pbase}^{=l} (n,l)$ and $p_R \in {\pbase}^l (l,l)$.
\end{proposition}

Proof: Elements $p_R$ of the given form can be used to `uncross any crossing'.
And they are invertible.

\begin{proposition}
The category composition defines  bijections
\begin{eqnarray}
 * :  {\pbase}^{l} (n,l)   \times     {\pbase}^{=l} (l,m)
 & \rightarrow  &   {\pbase}^{l} (n,m) 
\label{eq01}
\\
(p_L , p_R ) & \mapsto & p_L * p_R
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
 ** :  {\pbase}^{=l} (n,l) \times  {\pbase}^l (l,l) \times    {\pbase}^{=l} (l,m)
 & \rightarrow  &  {\pbase}^{l} (n,m) 
\\
(p_L , p_C , p_R)  &  \mapsto &  p_L * p_C * p_R
\end{eqnarray}
\end{proposition}




\subsection{Useful elements}

Fix a natural inclusion of algebras 
\[
P_{n-1} \subset P_{n}
\]
by 
$
p \mapsto p \cup \{ \{  n , n' \}\}   \;   =  p \circc 1_1
$.
The identity element in $P_0$ is the empty partition. Note that this
and the (iterated) inclusion map above determines the identity in $P_n$. 

Define an element 
\[
%a_1 = \{ \{ 1 \}, \{ 1' \}, ... \}
a_1 = \{ \{ 1 \}, \{ 1' \}  \}
\in P_1
\]
Define $a_1$ in $P_n$ by inclusion
(so it is <em> otherwise </em> the same as the identity element). 
That is $a_1 = \{ \{ 1 \} , \{ 1' \} \} \otimes 1_{n-1}$ in $P_n$.
Define $a_i$ similarly. 
Define 
\[
e_i = \frac{1}{\delta} a_i
\]
Note that this is idempotent. 
Define
$E_n = e_1 e_2 ... e_n$ 
and 
$E_n^l = e_1 e_2 ... e_{n-l}$. 
(The point of this notation is that, in $P_n$, 
$E_n^l$ is a scalar multiple of a partition with $l$ propagating components.)

Note the useful isomorphism
\begin{equation}
E_n^l P_n E_n^l \cong P_l  .
\end{equation}
In particular
we have
\[
%e_1 e_2 ... e_n
E_n P_n E_n = k E_n
\]
Now for any ring $R$ and idempotent $e \in R$, $eRe$ a local ring
implies that $e$ is primitive. 
Thus, $E_n$ is a primitive idempotent. 

\subsection{Ideals}
Consider the chain of ideals
\[
P_n \supset P_n e_1 P_n \supset P_n e_1 e_2 P_n \supset ...
\supset P_n e_1 e_2 ... e_n P_n
\]
Define $P_n^l = P_n e_1 e_2 ... e_{n-l} P_n$.
<!-- It is easy to check that -->
<br>
<b>Proposition.</b>
The ideal
$P_n^l$ is  spanned by partitions 
with at most $l$ propagating components. 
<br>
Proof: Exercise.
<br>
Define quotient algebra $P_n^{/l} = P_n / P_n^l$. 
This is like $P_n$, except that any partition basis element with $l$ or fewer
propagating components is congruent to 0.
<br>
In particular $E_n^m = 0$ unless $m > l$ in $P_n^{/l}$. 

Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group. 
\begin{proposition}
We have  isomorphisms of $k$-algebras 
\[
E_n^{l+1} P_n^{/l} E_n^{l+1} \cong P_{l+1}^{/l}
      \cong k S_{l+1}
\]
\end{proposition}
Proof:
We can choose a subset of the partition basis of $P_n$ to form a basis for the algebra
on the left.
 No such element on the left can have more than $l+1$ propagating components
by virtue of the factor $E_n^{l+1}$;
nor less than $l+1$ by virtue of the quotient. 

Consider a
 complete orthogonal idempotent decomposition of 
$
1 = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda
$
 in $kS_{l+1}$ 
(recall that such a decomposition exists for any artinian ring;
and that each $f_\lambda kS_{l+1} f_\lambda$ is a local ring
- see e.g. [AndersonFuller]).
<br>
This will now
give us a collection of primitive idempotents in $P_n^{/l}$:
setting 
$$
F_\lambda = E_{n-({l+1})} \circc f_{\lambda}
          = E_n ^{l+1} (1_{n-(l+1)} \circc f_\lambda )
$$ 
(in the  side-by-side notation)
we have
\[
F_\lambda P_n^{/l} F_\lambda = 
( E_{n-({l+1})} \circc f_\lambda ) 
    P_n^{/l} 
      ( E_{n-({l+1})} \circc f_\lambda ) 
= E_{n -( {l+1})} \circc  ( f_\lambda P_{l+1}^{/l} f_\lambda )
\cong f_\lambda (k S_{l+1} ) f_\lambda 
%= kf_\lambda
\]
a local ring. 
Thus 
\[
\Pi_\lambda = 
P_n^{/l} F_\lambda
\]
is indecomposable projective in the quotient. 
Hence it is indecomposable with simple head in $P_n$.


\subsection{Modules}
Define $P_n,P_n$-bimodule
\[
\bar{P}_n^l = P_n^l / P_n^{l-2}
\]
Note that this has a basis of 
the $(n,n)$-partitions with $l$ propagating `lines'
(components). 

We have the following useful decomposition...

Cf. Equation(\ref{eq01}).
