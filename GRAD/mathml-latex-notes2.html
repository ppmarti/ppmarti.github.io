<BODY BGCOLOR=white TEXT=black>
HAVE A LOOK AT THE SOURCE OF THIS EXAMPLE TO SEE HOW IT DOES IT!
<br>
Including MACROS!
<br>
See also 
Jipsen's original work
<a href="http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimathextend.html">
here</a>.

(More useful links etc 
at Knisely's possibly more regularly maintained page
<a href="http://math.etsu.edu/LaTeXMathML/"> here</a>.)

The main thing is the invocation of a script: 
<a href="../common/LaTeXMathML.js">LaTeXMathML.js</a>
(older version 
<a href="../common/LaTeXMathML.js.orig">LaTeXMathML.js</a>
).

This script is updated from time to time (by Knisely I guess) 
but one typically holds a local copy, so this is a snapshot from when it
was downloaded. The upshot is that differences in behaviour of LaTeXMathML
from page to page (see below for example) may be due to different 
local versions at the host site.


\section{Torture tests}
We can do
\[
\sqrt{\sqrt{\sqrt{2}}} = \int_{b}^{a} f(x) dx
\]
But:
There do appear to be some anomalies in certain font renderings at present.
For example in mathbb:
$\mathbb{M,N,L,P,R,Z}$

Interestingly the successes in rendering mathbb on Knisely's page (above)
seem to be the complement of those on Jipsen's page!
(As far as my Firefox browser is concerned, of course.)

 
\section{Intro notes on partition categories}
\subsection{Notation}

Here $S$ is a set. 
$\Gamma(S)$ is the set of loop-free undirected graphs on $S$. 

%\newcommand{\EE}{{\mathbf E}}

$\EE(S)$ is the set of partitions on $S$ (in natural bijection 
with the set of equivalence relations on $S$).
