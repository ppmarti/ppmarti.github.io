\subsection{Graded categories}
\subsubsection{On a Lemma of Levitzki}
Let $R$ be a ring and $S$ a subring.
Then $R$ is an $S$-bimodule by restriction.
We can ask if $R$ decomposes as $R = S \oplus S'$ as an $S$-bimodule.

For example, suppose that $R$ has a finite group of automorphisms $G$ (say),
with $|G|$ invertible in $R$,
and $S$ is the fixed ring.
That is, $S$ is the subring of elements fixed by $G$.
Set $t(r) = \sum_{g \in G} g(r)$ and $t' = |G|1 - t$,
so that $R  = t(R) + t'(R) = S + t'(R)$ as an abelian group. 
Then $s,t \in S$ implies $st \in S$ and $s \in S$, $s' \in t'(R)$
implies $ss', s's \in t'(R)$.
Indeed say $s' = t'(r)$. Then 
$ss' = s t'(r) = s (|G| r - \sum_{g \in G} g(r) ) = |G| sr - \sum s g(r)
     = |G| sr - \sum g(s) g(r) = |G| sr - \sum g(sr) = t'(sr)$.

For a specific example consider $R= \C$ and $G$ generated by complex conjugation. 
In this case $\C = \R \oplus i \R$ as an $\R$-module. 

\begin{lemma}
If  $R$ decomposes as $R = S \oplus S'$ as an $S$-bimodule,
and $R$ is semisimple, then so is $S$.
\end{lemma}

Proof: Here we take <em>semisimple</em> to mean that every left ideal
is a direct summand of the regular module.
<br>
Exercise: show that this is equivalent to the usual definition
(at least in the case of Artinian rings).
<br>
Now let $I$ be a left ideal of $S$. Then $RI$ is a left ideal of $R$
and hence a direct summand: $R = RI \oplus L$ say. 
Meanwhile $RI = (S \oplus S')I = I \oplus S'I$ as a left $S$-module. 
Since $I$ is a direct summand of $RI$ and $RI$ is of $R$ 
(as an $R$-module and hence as an $S$-module) 
then $I$ is a direct summand of $R$ as an $S$-module, 
lying in $S \subset R$, and hence a direct summand of $S$. 
$\Box$

More to follow.


\subsection{Subcategories of $\caP^1$}
The end-sets of $\caP^1$ are finite monoids. The complex representation
theory of these monoids is quite rich, but it is well understood
(see e.g. [M96,DW]).
(The modular representation theory is largely open, but is also 
dauntingly hard.)

On the other hand there are several interesting subcategories
and variants, some
providing open problems in representation theory.

\subsubsection{Planarity}
The plane drawn <a href="pcat.html#pdpic">pictures</a> of 
graphs and hence partitions in $\EE(n,m)$ 
that we use here are  a convenient representation, 
but such a drawing is not canonical. 
For example, neither the number of vertices nor the number of lines
in a picture of a given partition is fixed (although the minimum number
of each is fixed).
For another example, 
among the class of pictures that represent the same partition, the number of 
crossings of lines is not, of course, an invariant.
However there are properties of partitions in $\EE(n,m)$ that can be expressed conveniently
in terms of such pictures, and which `behave well' under composition. 

Recall that in the 
<a href="pcat-part.html#fdc">frame drawing convention </a>
for $\EE(n,m)$ the labelled 
vertices are drawn in a given order on the frame of the picture.
Thus any line between two such vertices separates the rectangle into two
open intervals (and the line itself). 
Every other vertex thus lies in one of the open regions.
A line between vertices in different regions necessarily crosses 
the first line. 

\begin{figure}
\caption{Lines realising a part in a partition, and an open interval
(shaded) defined by one such line.}
\includegraphics{xfig/grap011as3.gif}
\end{figure}

A partition in $\EE(n,m)$ is <em> plane </em> if it 
 can be drawn in the <a href="pcat-part.html#fdc"> frame drawing convention </a> without crossing lines.



\begin{proposition}
The restriction of (hom-sets in) 
$\caP^1$ to plane partitions defines a subcategory, $\caT^1$. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.

In a _given_ frame drawn picture of a partition, the subset of the plane consisting of the rectangle minus the lines falls into connected components.
We call these components <em>alcoves </em>.
(Note that alcoves are properties of pictures, 
not directly of partitions.)
In particular in our convention there is a leftmost component/alcove
(its closure includes the left edge of the frame).
A point is <em> left-exposed </em> if it lies in the closure of this component.

A partition in $\EE(n,m)$ is <em> 1-plane </em> if it 
 can be drawn in the <a href="pcat-part.html#fdc"> frame drawing convention </a> with only left-exposed crossing lines (i.e. left-exposed crossing points).

Note that fixing a partition does not in general dictate whether there is a line between
two vertices in a picture representing it (if they are in the same part
they may be connected by an indirect path in the representing graph).
Therefore
there is generally a lot of freedom in the number and position of line
crossings in the pictures of a partition.
The situation is clearer for pair-partitions, so we proceed with
this case next. 


\subsubsection{Pair partitions and dilution}
A pair partition is a partition in which every part contains two elements.
A dilute pair partition 
is a partition in which each part contains at most two elements. 
Let us write $\JJ(n,m)$ for the subset of $\EE(n,m)$ of pair partitions;
and $\DD(n,m)$ for the subset of dilute pair partitions. 
\begin{proposition}
The restriction of %%(hom-sets in) 
$\caP^1$ to pair partitions defines a subcategory, $\caB^1$. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.

\begin{proposition}
The restriction of $\caP^1$ to dilute pair partitions defines a subcategory. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.

\begin{proposition}
The restriction of $\caP^1$ to (dilute) plane pair partitions defines a subcategory. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.


\subsubsection{On pictures of pair partitions}

\begin{proposition}
Among pictures of $p \in \JJ(n,m)$ are `efficient' ones 
in which no line self-intersects;
and no two lines cross more than once;
and there are no interior vertices.
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise. 
(Roughly speaking, one can think of drawing each line as straight as possible.
Straight lines between vertices on the same edge of a frame are not
generic, but this can be fixed by `infinitessimal' deformation.)

Exercise: What happens to efficient pictures under composition?
The concatenation of pictures is a picture for the composite
partition, but not efficient in general. 
For example there are interior vertices.
One can easily replace a chain of lines with interior vertices by 
a single line with these lines as segments and no interior vertices.
But what else goes wrong?


The next few figures show some efficient 
pictures of pair partitions.
The <em> height </em> (or left-height) of an alcove
in such a picture is % and associate numbers to their alcoves
the minimum number of lines one has to cross to get from the alcove
to the left edge of the frame
(cf. [MGP,MM]). 
We show these numbers in the figures. 
The first two figures are pictures of the same pair partition.

<img src="xfig/grap010xas.gif">

Note that none of the pictures so far are 
pictures of 1-plane partitions. 
Note that a crossing 
is left-exposed if it meets a 0-alcove.
(Such a crossing also meets two 1-alcoves and a 2-alcove.) 

We say that a crossing is $m$-left-exposed if it meets an $m$-alcove
and no lower (cf. [GMP]) (i.e. it meets two $m+1$-alcoves). 

As noted, the concatenation of two efficient pictures of pair partitions
gives a picture of the composition pair partition,
but is not efficient in general. It may have loops 
of internal vertices for example.
<br>
Exercise: What can be said about alcoves under concatenation?
For example, can concatenation produce a higher alcove than in either
source picture?


\subsubsection{Near planarity - the Bob cat}

Suppose we have a plane pair partition $p \in \JJ(n,m)$ 
represented by a non-crossing 
picture. This has a set of left-exposed pairs (and this set is independent 
of the picture). 
We may construct a new pair partition $p'$ in $\JJ(n+1,m+1)$
from $p$ as follows. 
First add new vertices top and bottom left, and connect these (obviously
this can be done without introducing crossings to the picture).
Note that the new line can be deformed to have a point arbitrarily close
to any (or all) of the set of lines corresponding to the 
`left-exposed pairs' from $p$.
(Of course these are no longer left-exposed in $p'$.)
Now choose a subset $s$ of the set of originally left-exposed pairs.
For each chosen line in the picture - which has the new line approaching close
to it at a point by construction - replace the two line segments in 
a neighbourhood of this point by two crossing line segments.
This gives us a (picture of a) non-plane element $p_s$ of $\JJ(n+1,m+1)$.

It will be clear that this construction for $p_s$ is well-defined - 
i.e. not dependent on the pictures used.  

Note that this construction gives us a subset 
of $\JJ(n+1,m+1)$.
The subset 
consists of partitions with the property that 
(i) they can be drawn with only left-exposed crossings;
(ii) in any drawing the intersection of the leftmost alcove with the frame is a
connected interval of the frame (i.e. there are a sequence of 
touching segments of lines running from top-left to bottom-left vertex).
Let us write
$\JJ^1(n+1,m+1)$ 
for the set of all such partitions. 


The set $B(n,m)$ 
of pairs consisting of a plane pair partition $p$ in $\JJ(n,m)$ 
and a subset $s$ of the set of left-exposed pairs in $p$
is called the set of <em> blob partitions </em>. 
(Because they can be depicted by a picture of $p$ together with 
a `blob' or dot marked on each element of $s$.)

Exercise: Investigate the following.
We claim that the map $\psi: B(n,m) \rightarrow \JJ^1(n+1,m+1)$
constructed above is a bijection.
