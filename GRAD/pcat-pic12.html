%\subsection{Some `Night thoughts of a ... physicist' on this topic}
(`<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Thoughts_of_a_Classical_Physicist">Night thoughts of a classical physicist</a>') 
The following will not be needed later, but helps to show the risks we take
when using physical models of certain constructs in geometry...

\subsubsection{Pencil lines and knotted strings}
A `curve' is a homeomorphic image of an interval of the real line, typically 
in $\R^2$. 
The sense in which a pencil line represents a curve is complicated,
and the representation is flawed in several ways. 
There is no sense in which the atoms in the pencil line form a 
`linear continuum',
even from a classical perspective; and they cannot, in any case, be 
localised with arbitrary accuracy, on quantum mechanical grounds. 
<p>
Pencil lines do look like dense linear arrays of points on a number 
of length scales. And if they looked like such on all length scales
then they would be better approximations to 
`real lines' in the analytical sense.
The abstraction of a phenomenon which survives across several length
scales to one that survives across all length scales is
a very convenient simplification (not only in analysis, but 
essentially in all modes of human understanding, since, as thinking machines, 
we are apparently finite).
This leaves us with analysis as an abstract tool - but leaves it
separated from the real-world phenomena which suggested it.
