\subsection{On  subcategories of $\caP^1$}
The end-sets of $\caP^1$ are finite monoids. The complex representation
theory of these monoids is quite rich, but it is well understood
(see e.g. [M96,DW]).
(The modular representation theory is largely open, but is also 
dauntingly hard.)

On the other hand there are several interesting subcategories
and variants, some
providing open problems in representation theory.
(Older examples include: 
[...,Brauer,Green,Grimm,AlvarezMartin,Mazorchuk,Saleur,TemperleyLieb,tomDieck,...] 
more refs to follow.)

\subsection{Pair partitions and dilution}
A pair partition is a partition in which every part contains two elements.
A dilute pair partition 
is a partition in which each part contains at most two elements. 
Let us write $\JJ(n,m)$ for the subset of $\EE(n,m)$ of pair partitions;
and $\DD(n,m)$ for the subset of dilute pair partitions. 
\begin{proposition}
The restriction of %%(hom-sets in) 
$\caP^1$ to pair partitions defines a subcategory, $\caB^1$. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.

The end-sets of $\caB^1$ are the Brauer monoids. Some asides on 
the associated Brauer algebras are <a href="pcat-brauer.html">here</a>.


\begin{proposition}
The restriction of $\caP^1$ to dilute pair partitions defines a subcategory. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.

\subsection{Planarity}
The plane drawn <a href="pcat.html#pdpic">pictures</a> of 
graphs and hence partitions in $\EE(n,m)$ 
that we use here are  a convenient representation, 
but such a drawing is not canonical. 
For example, neither the number of vertices nor the number of lines
in a picture of a given partition is fixed (although the minimum number
of each is fixed).
For another example, 
among the class of pictures that represent the same partition, the number of 
crossings of lines is not, of course, an invariant.
However there are properties of partitions in $\EE(n,m)$ that can be expressed conveniently
in terms of such pictures, and which `behave well' under composition. 

Recall that in the 
<a href="pcat-part.html#fdc">frame drawing convention </a>
for $\EE(n,m)$ the labelled 
vertices are drawn in a given order on the frame of the picture.
Thus any line between two such vertices separates the rectangle into two
open intervals (and the line itself). 
Every other vertex thus lies in one of the open regions.
A line between vertices in different regions necessarily crosses 
the first line. 

\begin{figure}
\caption{(i) Lines realising a part in a partition in $\EE(6,6)$, 
and an open interval
(shaded) defined by one such line $l$.
(ii) Alternative realisation of the same partition.}
\includegraphics{xfig/grap011as3.gif}
\end{figure}

A partition in $\EE(n,m)$ is <em> plane </em> if it 
 can be drawn in the <a href="pcat-part.html#fdc"> frame drawing convention </a> without crossing lines.



\begin{proposition}
The restriction of (hom-sets in) 
$\caP^1$ to plane partitions defines a subcategory, $\caT^1$. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.

In a _given_ frame drawn picture of a partition, the subset of the plane consisting of the rectangle minus the lines falls into connected components.
We call these components <em>alcoves </em>.
(Note that <a href="pcat.html#alcove">alcoves</a> are properties of pictures, 
not directly of partitions.)
In particular in our convention there is a leftmost component/alcove
(its closure includes the left edge of the frame).
<br>
A point is <em> left-exposed </em> if it lies in the closure of the leftmost 
alcove.

A partition in $\EE(n,m)$ is <em> 1-plane </em> if it 
 can be drawn in the <a href="pcat-part.html#fdc"> frame drawing convention </a> with only left-exposed crossing lines (i.e. left-exposed crossing points).

Note that fixing a partition does not in general dictate whether there is a line between
two vertices in a picture representing it (if they are in the same part
they may be connected by an indirect path in the representing graph).
Therefore
there is generally a lot of freedom in the number and position of line
crossings in the pictures of a partition.
The situation is clearer for pair-partitions, so we proceed with
this case next. 



\begin{proposition}
The restriction of $\caP^1$ to (dilute) plane pair partitions defines a subcategory. 
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise.


\subsection{On pictures of pair partitions in $\JJ(n,m)$}
Of course crossings of lines cannot be avoided in general in our frame 
drawn pictures of 
graphs, and in particular of pair partitions in $\JJ(n,m)$. 
Indeed, given the frame drawn picture conventions, the property that
the two lines associated to two pair-parts necessarily cross in any
picture is intrinsic to the underlying partition. However
the  order of crossings 
(i.e. the order in which the line associated to one pair meets
the lines associated to other pairs)
is not fixed. 
We are interested here in other `crossing properties' that <em> are </em> 
intrinsic to the underlying partition. 
Recall that a graph `picture' on an interval $R$ has the property that no
interior point of $R$ is common to three lines.
 
\begin{proposition}
Among pictures of pair partitions $p \in \JJ(n,m)$ are `efficient' ones 
in which (Ia) no line self-intersects;
and (Ib) no two lines cross more than once;
and (II) there are no interior vertices.
\end{proposition}
Proof: exercise. 
<br>
Roughly speaking, one can think of drawing each line as straight as possible.
Straight lines between vertices on the same edge of a rectangular frame are not
generic, but this can be fixed by `infinitessimal' deformation of the paths;
or by working on a marked disk, 
possibly with infinitessimal deformations of the vertex
positions.
(See Figures (i),(ii) below.)
Specifically, note that straight lines on the marked disk automatically 
satisfy (I,II), so the only issue is 
if such a construction gives a 
<a href="pcat.html#pdp">picture</a>, i.e. the issue is of 
generic-ness in the sense of triple points.
But by (Ib) there are finitely many crossings, 
so every crossing point has a neighbourhood containing no other 
crossing points;
so for every crossing
one can move one of the four vertices involved by a small amount
(hence moving the crossing) without moving the crossing point 
onto another crossing point. Thus if there is a triple crossing this
can be resolved into three crossings, without introducing any other
triple crossings, by a small move of a single vertex.

<p>
Exercise: What happens to efficient pictures under composition?
The concatenation of pictures is a picture for the composite
partition, but not efficient in general. 
For example there are interior vertices.
One can easily replace a chain of lines with interior vertices by 
a single line with these lines as segments and no interior vertices.
But what else goes wrong?


The next few figures show some efficient 
pictures of pair partitions.

The <em> height </em> (or left-height) of an
<a href="pcat.html#alcove">alcove</a>
in such a picture is % and associate numbers to their alcoves
the minimum number of lines one has to cross to get from the alcove
to the left edge of the frame
(cf. [MGP,MM]). 
<br>
Note that if a line from exterior vertex to exterior vertex
in a frame drawn picture  
is non-self-crossing then it separates the framed region into three components
(two open regions and the line itself). One component contains the 
left-hand edge. Thus each such line contributes to the height 
at an alcove point (+0 if on the same side; +1 otherwise).  
If there are no double-crossings then (CLAIM) these
individual contributions together give the height.
If there are double crossings then there may be points on the 0-side
of both of two lines, for which there is nonetheless no path
to the left, because the lines overlap.
In this case the height is greater than the sum of contributions from 
individual lines.  

We show these height numbers in the figures. 
The first two figures are pictures of the same pair partition. 

<!-- <img src="xfig/grap010x.gif"> --!>
\begin{figure}
\caption{Plane drawn pictures of pair partitions with alcove heights}
\includegraphics{xfig/grap010xb1.gif}
\end{figure}

<img src="xfig/grap010xb2.gif" align="right">

<img src="xfig/grap010xas.gif">

Note that none of the pictures so far are 
pictures of 1-plane partitions. 
Note that a crossing 
is left-exposed if it meets a 0-alcove.
(Such a crossing also meets two 1-alcoves and a 2-alcove.) 

We say that a crossing in a picture is $m$-<em>left-exposed</em> 
(or height $m$)
if it meets an $m$-alcove
and no lower (cf. [GMP]) (i.e. it meets two $m+1$-alcoves). 

We write $\JJ_l(m,n)$ for the subset of $\JJ(m,n)$ of elements 
having a picture in which no crossing is higher than $l$-left-exposed.
We take $\JJ_{-1}(m,n)$ to be the subset of elements (having a picture)
with no crossings. Then 
$\JJ_{-1}(m,n) \subseteq 
 \JJ_{ 0}(m,n) \subseteq 
 \JJ_{ 1}(m,n) \subseteq ... \subseteq \JJ(m,n)$.

<p>
Exercise: How can we determine which $\JJ_l(m,n)$ a partition 
$p \in \JJ(n,m)$ is in?
How can we draw a picture of 
$p$ which realises this lowest height?


\subsubsection{Concatenation of pictures}

\begin{figure}
\caption{Concatenation and straightening of pictures with marked alcove 
heights}
\includegraphics{xfig/grap010c1.gif}
\end{figure}
<!--
<img src="xfig/grap010c1.gif">
--!>

As noted, the concatenation of two efficient pictures of pair partitions
gives a picture of the composition pair partition,
but is not efficient in general. It may have loops 
of internal vertices for example.
<br>
Exercise: What can be said about alcoves under concatenation?
For example, can concatenation produce a higher alcove than in either
source picture?
<br>
Let $A,B$ be compatible pictures and $A|B$ be the concatenation. 
Note that an alcove of $A|B$ is either an alcove of $A$ or $B$ or a 
union of alcoves from each. The height of this alcove cannot exceed
the height of the lowest contributing alcove (since a route to the left
giving this number in $A$ or $B$ is still a route to the left  in 
$A|B$). 
Thus concatenation cannot produce a higher height in $A|B$ than in 
$A$ and $B$ together. 
So the question is if straightening a picture can produce higher alcoves. 

Apart from isotopies (which do not change the alcove heights),
straightening consists of (i) loop removal; 
(ii) twist (self-crossing) removal;
(iii) double-crossing removal;
(iv) braid moves.
<br>
It will be evident that (i) removes a line, and hence cannot increase
a alcove height at any point. Essentially the same is true for (ii). 
<br>
One can show that the the set of heights appearing after a double-crossing removal are a subset 
of those before. 
In the relevant neighbourhood of a picture this looks like one of the 
following: 
<img src="xfig/move1.gif">
<br>

And one can show that the set of heights 
after a braid move are the same as before,
as in the neighbourhood here:

<img src="xfig/move2.gif">

(In both cases the specific alcoves in the picture change, of course.)


Here is a picture of a pair partition (in $\EE(7,7)$) drawn on a disk,
using only straight lines;
and a concatenation of such pictures:

\subsubsection{Near planarity - the Bob cat}

The categories $\caT^1$ and $\caB^1$ both have very rich
representation theory (and also many applications). 
It is therefore interesting to investigate a series of
categories that interpolate between them. 
Perhaps the simplest of these is constructed next (we call it the 
Bob category for now - for reasons to be explained later). 


Suppose we have a plane pair partition $p \in \JJ(n,m)$ 
represented by a non-crossing 
picture. This has a set of left-exposed pairs (and this set is independent 
of the picture). 
We may construct a new pair partition $p'$ in $\JJ(n+1,m+1)$
from $p$ as follows. 
First add new vertices top and bottom left, and connect these (obviously
this can be done without introducing crossings to the picture).

\begin{figure}
\caption{(i) Plane partition with new pair (in red). (ii) Deformation close to 
chosen two (out of three) left-exposed lines. (iii) Replacement of first pair with a crossing. (iv) Overall resultant non-plane partition.}
\includegraphics{xfig/grasp1p2.gif}
\end{figure}

Note that the new line can be deformed to have a point arbitrarily close
to any (or all) of the set of lines corresponding to the 
`left-exposed pairs' from $p$.
(Of course these are no longer left-exposed in $p'$.)
Now choose a subset $s$ of the set of originally left-exposed pairs.
For each chosen line in the picture - which has the new line approaching close
to it at a point by construction - replace the two line segments in 
a neighbourhood of this point by two crossing line segments.
This gives us a (picture of a) non-plane element $p_s$ of $\JJ(n+1,m+1)$.

It will be clear that this construction for $p_s$ is well-defined - 
i.e. not dependent on the pictures used.  

Note that this construction gives us a subset 
of $\JJ(n+1,m+1)$.
The subset 
consists of partitions with the property that 
(i) they can be drawn with only left-exposed crossings;
(ii) in any drawing the intersection of the leftmost alcove with the frame is a
connected interval of the frame (i.e. there are a sequence of 
touching segments of lines running from top-left to bottom-left vertex).
Let us write
$\JJ^1(n+1,m+1)$ 
for the set of all such partitions. 


The set $B(n,m)$ 
of pairs consisting of a plane pair partition $p$ in $\JJ(n,m)$ 
and a subset $s$ of the set of left-exposed pairs in $p$
is called the set of <em> blob partitions </em>. 
(Because they can be depicted by a picture of $p$ together with 
a `blob' or dot marked on each element of $s$.)

Exercise: Investigate the following.
We claim that the map $\psi: B(n,m) \rightarrow \JJ^1(n+1,m+1)$
constructed above is a bijection. 

\subsubsection{Beyond the Bobcat}
The following figure effectively determines the combinatorics of $\JJ_1(n,m)$
(cf. [MM1]). 
The figure starts as a version of the 
augmented Bratteli diagram for the Brauer algebra
but, roughly speaking, one must avoid pictures violating the height
`ceiling' rule. 
This first manifests itself in that the 4th string in the 4-propagating lines
part at $n=4$ cannot cross another line.

\subsubsection{Bilateral grading}
This is what it sounds like (or else see latex notes!). Many of the 
subcategory defining constraints, such as this one, commute. So we 
get more subcategories. For example
(fig taken from latex notes):
<div style="overflow:hidden;">
<img src="subcat.svg" alt="" style="margin:-23% 0px -32% 0px;" /> 
</div>

Some of these combinations may be more intrinsically interesting than
others (that is another story). Some are interesting mainly because
their representation theory presents an interesting challenge...
