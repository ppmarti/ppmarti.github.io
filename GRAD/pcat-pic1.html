%\subsubsection{Graphs and pictures}
\section{On `Pictures' (of graphs, say) }
A `picture' is a device for using the human GPU
(cf. references in, say, <a href="http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/editorials/p6057.pdf">[Changizi]</a>). 
In as far as this can
be formalised, it incorporates aspects of low-dimensional geometric topology,
and some more sophisticated statistical analysis
(we will suppress the latter).

\subsection{Graphs and pictures and sketches}

It will be useful to
 represent a <a href="pcat.html">graph $g=(V,E,f)$</a>
on a countable vertex set by a
`picture' (roughly as in the picture below). 
This is useful for a number of reasons. Firstly it gives a handy way of
representing specific graphs. Secondly it works well with certain ideas of
graph composition. Thirdly, it gives a natural way of describing some
important special cases, such as planar graphs. 

However, the use of pictures raises several points of technical difficulty
- from the formal to the philosophical. We address some of these here.
Our starting point is that people want to (and do) represent graphs
using pictures like the one below. 
How are such pictures to be understood?
We address this in two main steps. Firstly, by considering sets
constructed in Euclidean geometry that determine graphs;
and secondly by considering `models' of such Euclidean geometric
constructions that can be realised in the real world.
(Just for a moment, we might call the former `pictures' and the latter
`sketches' of pictures - but we will soon pragmatically blur the distinction.)

%Exercise: 
%It will be useful to 
% represent a graph $g$ on a countable vertex set by a picture. 
A <em>plane drawn picture</em>
$(R,S)$ 
is a closed rectangular interval of the plane $R$ together with a subset $S$
consisting of smoothly embedded line intervals terminating at
certain marked points. 
<p>
<p>
The first thing to note is that 
 such a thing can only be approximated by a `drawn picture' 
(or `sketch') in the 
artistic sense. 
Indeed there is nothing in the `physical laboratory' corresponding to
a homeomorphic image of a real interval;
just as a physical knot or braid is not much like a mathematical knot or 
braid. 
However, we will use PDPs in such a way that 
such approximations are
generally sufficient. With this caveat we will speak of `drawing' PDPs,
and indeed speak of pictures such as the one on the right as if they
are PDPs.
<p>

In order to represent a graph $g=(V,E,f)$ by such a picture $(R,S)$,
one proceeds as follows. 
First one draws  marked points such that each may be identified with a 
 vertex in $V$. 
Each edge $\epsilon$ in $E$ is then represented by a line interval
between the vertices in $f(\epsilon)$, and labelled by $\epsilon$.
There is much freedom of choice in this, but one wants 
that a complete single line can be determined unambiguously from the
drawn set of lines.
To this end the set of line interval embeddings is
chosen to be 
<br>
&nbsp
<em>generic</em>, in the sense that 
if two lines  meet at a point the tangents do not coincide,
and no line meets a marked point except at an endpoint.
<br>
(This is sophistry, in that it is not really possible to determine
tangents to lines by looking at pictures, except within some tolerance.
Thus if we use pictures in practice, tangents must not only be 
different, but sufficiently different.)
<p>
In such a picture we shall call the boundary of the rectangular region
the <em> frame </em>.
A vertex may lie on the frame (call such a vertex <em>exterior</em>), 
but by convention 
a line interval may touch the frame
only at its endpoints.
 
<p>
<a name="alcove"></a>
An <em> alcove </em> of such a picture $(R,S)$ is a connected component of 
$R \setminus S$.
