\section{Representation theory}

Fix a field $k$ and an element $\delta \in k$.
This fixes a partition category $\caP$ 
and, for each $n \in \mathbb{N}$, 
the partition algebra $P_n$ as the $n$-th End-set $\caP(n,n)$ in $\caP$. 
<br>
Write $\circc$ for the monoidal composition in $\caP$, given by 
side-by-side (as opposed to vertical) composition of partition diagrams.
<br>
Write $1_n$ for the identity element in $\caP(n,n)$. 
<br>
\subsection{Notations, pictures and decompositions for set partitions}

%Write 
$P^{\circ}(n,m)$ denotes the 
basis of hom-set $\caP(n,m)$ consisting of 
set partitions (of the set consisting of a row of $n$
and a row of $m$ `vertices', labelled $1,2,...,n$ and $1',2',...,m'$
respectively). 
<br>
%Write 
${\pbase}^l (n,m)$ denotes the subset of ${\pbase} (n,m)$ consisting of
partitions with $l$ propagating parts. 
<br>
Note that in $p \in {\pbase}^l (n,l)$ each primed vertex lies in a distinct 
propagating part.  
<br>
Remark:
Fix a partition $p$ in ${\pbase} (n,m)$. 
Each propagating part has a lowest numbered vertext
from $1,2,...,n$ and a lowest numbered vertex from $1',2',...,m'$. 
<br>
One could draw a picture for $p$ 
(i.e. a relative graph $g$ such that $\pp(g)=p$)
in which the only lines drawn between the unprimed
and the primed side correspond to propagating parts, 
and are drawn between lowest-numbered
unprimed vertex and lowest-numbered primed vertex in each case.
<br> 
Indeed one could draw a picture of $p$ in which the only lines drawn
between unprimed (resp. primed) vertices are between pairs adjacent
in the natural order in the same part.
See Fig.\ref{fig0x} for example. 
We will call pictures drawn in this way <em> low-neat </em>.

\begin{proposition}
Every $p \in {\pbase}^l (n,m)$ 
can be expressed in the form $p = p_L * p_R$ where 
$p_L \in {\pbase}^l (n,l)$ and $p_R \in {\pbase}^l (l,m)$. 
\end{proposition}

Proof: use the remarks about pictures above. 
 
<p>
Remark: the decomposition $p = p_L * p_R$ above is not unique in general.
In order to have a useful unique decomposition we need to organise 
partitions in a slightly non-canonical way, for example as follows.

The `low-shell' of $p \in {\pbase} (n,m)$ 
is the partition obtained by replacing each propagating part
by a part containing just the two lowest numbered elements
(one primed, one unprimed), with all other elements
being singletons.
We say two propagating parts are low-non-crossing
if their image in the low-shell is non-crossing in the obvious sense. 
We say $p$ is low-non-crossing if each pair of propagating parts is
low-non-crossing.
For example $1_n$ is (equal to its low-shell and) low-non-crossing.

Low-shell example:
\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{fig0x} A partition drawn low-neat, and its low-shell}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{xfig/partit-low1.gif}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{fig1x} A partition in $\pbase^{3}(7,3)$ and its low-shell}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{xfig/partit-low2.gif}
\end{figure}

Note that the middle (dashed) horizontal line drawn in Fig.\ref{fig1x} separates
the partition into a low-non-crossing partition and a permutation
(in $S_3$, or in $\pbase^{3}(3,3)$, as it were).

Note that $p$ can be low-non-crossing without being a plane partition.

<p>
%Let 
${\pbase}^{=l}(n,m)$ denotes the subset of ${\pbase}^l (n,m)$
consisting of low-non-crossing elements.

\begin{proposition}
Every $p \in {\pbase}^{l} (n,l)$
can be expressed in the form $p_L * p_R$ where
$p_L \in {\pbase}^{=l} (n,l)$ and $p_R \in {\pbase}^l (l,l)$.
\end{proposition}

Proof: Elements $p_R$ of the given form can be used to `uncross any crossing'.
And they are invertible.

\begin{proposition}
The category composition defines  bijections
\begin{eqnarray}
 * :  {\pbase}^{l} (n,l)   \times     {\pbase}^{=l} (l,m)
 & \rightarrow  &   {\pbase}^{l} (n,m) 
\label{eq01}
\\
(p_L , p_R ) & \mapsto & p_L * p_R
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
 ** :  {\pbase}^{=l} (n,l) \times  {\pbase}^l (l,l) \times    {\pbase}^{=l} (l,m)
 & \rightarrow  &  {\pbase}^{l} (n,m) 
\\
(p_L , p_C , p_R)  &  \mapsto &  p_L * p_C * p_R
\end{eqnarray}
\end{proposition}




\subsection{Useful elements of $P_n$}

Fix a natural inclusion of algebras 
\[
P_{n-1} \subset P_{n}
\]
by 
$
p \mapsto p \cup \{ \{  n , n' \}\}   \;   =  p \circc 1_1
$.
The identity element in $P_0$ is the empty partition. Note that this
and the (iterated) inclusion map above determines the identity in $P_n$. 

Define an element 
\[
%a_1 = \{ \{ 1 \}, \{ 1' \}, ... \}
a_1 = \{ \{ 1 \}, \{ 1' \}  \}
\in P_1
\]
Define $a_1$ in $P_n$ by inclusion
(so it is <em> otherwise </em> the same as the identity element). 
That is $a_1 = \{ \{ 1 \} , \{ 1' \} \} \otimes 1_{n-1}$ in $P_n$.
Define $a_i$ similarly. 
Assuming (for now) that $\delta$ is a unit in $k$, define 
\[
e_i = \frac{1}{\delta} a_i
\]
Note that this is idempotent. 
Define
$E_n = e_1 e_2 ... e_n$ 
and 
$E_n^l = e_1 e_2 ... e_{n-l}$. 
(The point of this notation is that, in $P_n$, 
$E_n^l$ is a scalar multiple of a partition with $l$ propagating components.)

Note the useful isomorphism
\begin{equation}
E_n^l P_n E_n^l \cong P_l  .
\end{equation}
In particular
we have
\[
%e_1 e_2 ... e_n
E_n P_n E_n = k E_n
\]
Now for any ring $R$ and idempotent $e \in R$, $eRe$ a local ring
implies that $e$ is primitive. 
Thus, $E_n$ is a primitive idempotent. 

\subsection{Ideals}
Consider the chain of ideals
\[
P_n \supset P_n e_1 P_n \supset P_n e_1 e_2 P_n \supset ...
\supset P_n e_1 e_2 ... e_n P_n
\]
Define $P_n^l = P_n e_1 e_2 ... e_{n-l} P_n$.
(Explicitly, $P_n^n = P_n$, $P_n^{n-1} = P_n e_1 P_n$, 
... , $P_n^{0} = P_n e_1 e_2 ... e_n P_n$, 
and we take also $P_n^{-1} = 0$.)
<!-- It is easy to check that -->
<br>
<b>Proposition.</b>
The ideal
$P_n^l$ is  spanned by partitions 
with at most $l$ propagating components. 
<br>
Proof: Exercise.
<br>
Define quotient algebra 
$$
P_n^{/l} = P_n / P_n^l .
$$ 
This is like $P_n$, except that any partition basis element with $l$ or fewer
propagating components is congruent to 0.
<br>
In particular the idempotent $E_n^m = 0$ unless $m > l$ in $P_n^{/l}$. 

Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group. 
\begin{proposition}
We have  isomorphisms of $k$-algebras 
\[
E_n^{l+1} P_n^{/l} E_n^{l+1} \cong P_{l+1}^{/l}
      \cong k S_{l+1}
\]
\end{proposition}
Proof:
We can choose a subset of the partition basis of $P_n$ to form a basis for the algebra
on the left.
 No such element on the left can have more than $l+1$ propagating components
by virtue of the factor $E_n^{l+1}$;
nor less than $l+1$ by virtue of the quotient. 

Consider a
 complete orthogonal idempotent decomposition of $1 \in kS_{l+1}$:
$$
1 = \sum_\lambda f_\lambda
$$
% in $kS_{l+1}$ 
Recall that such a decomposition exists for any artinian ring;
and that each $f_\lambda kS_{l+1} f_\lambda$ is a local ring
- see e.g. [AndersonFuller].
In our case, if $k = \C$ say, the idempotents may be indexed by 
$\lambda \in \Lambda_{l+1}^{st}$,
the set of standard Young tableau associated to all the integer partitions of $l+1$.
<br>
This will now
give us a certain collection of primitive idempotents in $P_n^{/l}$:
for any $\lambda \in \Lambda_{l+1}^{st}$ setting 
$$
F_\lambda = E_{n-({l+1})} \circc f_{\lambda}
          = E_n ^{l+1} (1_{n-(l+1)} \circc f_\lambda )
$$ 
(in the  side-by-side notation)
we have
\[
F_\lambda P_n^{/l} F_\lambda = 
( E_{n-({l+1})} \circc f_\lambda ) 
    P_n^{/l} 
      ( E_{n-({l+1})} \circc f_\lambda ) 
= E_{n -( {l+1})} \circc  ( f_\lambda P_{l+1}^{/l} f_\lambda )
\cong f_\lambda (k S_{l+1} ) f_\lambda 
%= kf_\lambda
\]
a local ring. 
Thus the left ideal 
\[
\Pi_\lambda = 
P_n^{/l} F_\lambda
\]
is indecomposable projective in the quotient $P_n^{/l}$. 

Hence for each $l\in \{ -1,0,...,n-1 \}$ and each $\lambda \in \Lambda_{l+1}$ 
the module $\Pi_\lambda$ is also an 
indecomposable $P_n$-module with simple head.


\subsection{Modules}
Define $P_n,P_n$-bimodule
\[
\bar{P}_n^l = P_n^l / P_n^{l-2}
\]
Note that this has a basis $\pbase^l(n,n)$ (of 
the $(n,n)$-partitions with $l$ propagating parts).
%`lines' (components). 

We have the following useful decomposition as a left-module
\[
\bar{P}_n^l = \oplus_{p_R \in \pbase^{=l}(l,n)} k \pbase^{l}(n,l) * p_R
\]
Cf. Equation(\ref{eq01}), noting that each $k \pbase^{l}(n,l) * p_R$
is a $P_n$-module by virtue of the quotient
(action of $P_n$ from the left on some $p_L * p_R$ does not 
change $p_R$ unless it reduces the number of propagating lines, 
in which case the action gives 0). 

It will be clear that each of these summands is isomorphic, so we can
study $\bar{P}_n^l$ as a left-module by studying  $k \pbase^{l}(n,l) * p_R$,
or indeed  $k \pbase^{l}(n,l) $.
Note that the latter is also a right $kS_l$-module in an obvious way,
indeed it is a free module. Thus we have a functor 
\[
S : kS_l - mod \rightarrow P_n-mod
\]
given by $M \mapsto  k \pbase^{l}(n,l) \otimes_{kS_l} M$. 

The idempotent decomposition of 1 in $kS_l$ as above induces
a decomposition 
\[
k \pbase^{l}(n,l) \cong \oplus_\lambda \Pi_\lambda
\]  
Altogether then, we see that the left regular module may be filtered by
the  indecomposable modules of form $\Pi_\lambda$ (all possible $\lambda$).

In the complex case (for example) it will be clear that  
$kS_l f_\lambda \cong kS_l f_\mu$ if and only if 
the underlying Young diagrams of $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are the same. 
Thus a complete set of $\Pi_\lambda$ modules is obtained by taking
one of each shape. 

It will be clear that $e_1 P_n e_1 \cong P_{n-1}$. 
Indeed $e_i P_n e_i \cong P_{n-1}$ for any suitable $i$.
It follows that
we have a functor 
\[
G : P_{n-1}-mod \rightarrow P_n-mod
\]
given by $M \mapsto P_n e_n \otimes M$.
Next we will show that $G(\Pi_\lambda ) = \Pi_\lambda$
(the reader should take care to consider the meaning of this identity).
 We will be able to use this to determine the structure of $P_n$ by
induction on $n$ (using the fact that $P_0$ and $P_1$ are simple base 
cases which may be analysed by brute force).
