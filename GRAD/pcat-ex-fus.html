We aim to summarize the definition of a 
<em>ribbon fusion category</em> (RFC), also known as
premodular category.
<br>
(Then we can talk about modular tensor categories (MTC), and 
unitary MTCs (UMTC). 
<br>
"Physically: UMTCs are algebraic formulations of anyon models.
And of unitary TQFTs. In some dimension!")
<br>
<small>
The definition runs over many pages, so the idea of a summary is to
capture the flavour of the definition in some kind of useful way!
<br>
RFC has a diagram calculus analogous to, but much more sophisticated than,
that of a partition category. One aim is to put these in a common context.
</small>

<p>
RFC = `pivotal fusion category' + compatible `braiding'.
So we need to know that these are!

<p>

\subsubsection{ FC}

A fusion category C over 
algebraically closed field k 
(of char. 0)
is a 
<br>
k-linear semisimple rigid
tensor (=monoidal) category <br>
with finitely many simple objects
(`rank of C' = # simple objects)
<br>
and f.d. spaces of morphisms, such that the end-algebra of neutral object 0
is k.

<p>
Most of the terms above we have defined already. 
<br>
(Recall a k-linear category is an abelian category
where arrow sets are k-modules and compositions k-bilinear.
<br>
An abelian category is an additive category with kernels, cokernels;
(mono/epi)morphisms are the (/co)kernels of their (co/)kernels;
every morphism f=g.h =mono.epi.)
<br>
Here come the rest...
<p>
A tensor category is <em>rigid</em> if it has dual objects and the contravariant
dual object functor is an anti-selfequivalence.

An object x in an abelian category is simple if 
every x ->> y and every z (-> x is isomorphism.

An object is semisimple if it is a direct sum of simples.
An abelian category is semisimple if every object is.

In a semisimple tensor category we can express a (x) b 
as a direct sum. Hence we have multiplicities of simple summands
up to isomorphism. These are written
<br>
a (x) b  &nbsp = (+)_c N^c_ab c
<br>
I.e. as analogues of Clebsch-Gordan series.
 

<p>
\subsubsection{Pivotal}
FC is <em>pivotal </em> if for every  object x there is in 
hom(x,x**) an isomorphism phi such that
<br>
phi_{x (x) y}  = phi_x (x) phi_y
<br>
and ...  
<br>
f** = f
<br>
for all morphisms f (where f in hom(x,y) gives a dual
f* in hom(y*,x*) by ...).

<p>
\subsubsection{Braiding and compatibility}
A braiding is for each  (x,y) an element c in hom(x (x) y,y (x) x)
satisfying certain properties.
To describe compatibility we need to combine the braiding with 
birth and death (from rigidity) to make `twist'.

<small> Remark:
There is quite a gulf between the formal and diagram calculus versions of
these ideas (involving strictness...). 
The general idea is possibly simplest conveyed in the calculus. But the power
of the calculus is very hard to control.
