The blob algebras (this page is a work in progress!)</b>
</h3>
Consider the Brauer algebra B_n as a subalgebra of the partition algebra.
(See <a href="../projects.html">here</a> for the partition algebra.)
Consider in particular the diagram basis (certain pictures of partitions 
of a set of n+n elements drawn in a rectangular frame), 
and the algebra multiplication formulated in terms of 
a corresponding  diagram juxtaposition.
From this 
one sees that 
there is a subalgebra with basis the subset
of non-crossing diagrams. This is the TL algebra - an algebra
of considerable significance in many areas of mathematics and physics.
The blob algebra is a generalisation of the TL algebra as we now indicate. 
<p> 
The  non-crossing idea involves drawing diagrams on a rectangle.
It is natural 
(particularly from a computational physics perspective)
to consider a generalisation where one draws diagrams on a
cylinder, and distinguishes closed loops
(formed in diagram composition) that are non-contractible.
Rather than address this algebra directly, it is convenient to study
an algebra in which the cohomological data is encoded in a blob on 
the `seam' (a line drawn on the cylinder to cut it open, 
and hence return to the rectangle). 
This is the idea of the blob algebra.  
(Although it can also be characterised in a number of other interesting ways...)

<p>
One of the most interesting aspects of the study of the blob algebra concerns its representation theory.
Its `reductive' representation theory 
over algebraically closed fields 
is quite completely understood (see [Cox et al] 
and references therein). But a number of other interesting questions
about it and its generalisations remain open.
