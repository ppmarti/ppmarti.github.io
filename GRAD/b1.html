The Hecke algebras and alcove geometry 
(this page is a work in progress!)</b>
</h3>
We assume you are familiar with the braid group
(see e.g. [Martin91] Ch.5). 
Here is a braid 
drawn from top to bottom, separated nominally into three parts,
as it were $b = 1 \times g_{n-1} \times 1$:

<p>
As the picture indicates, we want to make a new braid 
picture by twisting the 
indicated part in the middle through 180 degrees.
Of course this will not change the braid, 
but it will now be written $b = M g_1 M^{-1}$
where
<p>
$M=$
<image src="./TwistBraid3.gif" width="130">
<p>
It will be evident from this that $M^2$ lies in the centre of the braid group.
Thus it also lies in the centre of the group algebra; and also in the centre of
any quotient algebra ...such as the Hecke algebra. 
<p>
By Schur's Lemma it follows that we can use $M^2$ to study the blocks of 
the Hecke algebra, or indeed any further quotient such as the TL algebra.
<p>
Exercise: compute the action of $M^2$ on TL standard modules.
(This is easy.)

Consider the Brauer algebra B_n as a subalgebra of the partition algebra.
(See <a href="../projects.html">here</a> for the partition algebra.)
Consider in particular the diagram basis (certain pictures of partitions 
of a set of n+n elements drawn in a rectangular frame), 
and the algebra multiplication formulated in terms of 
a corresponding  diagram juxtaposition.
From this 
one sees that 
there is a subalgebra with basis the subset
of non-crossing diagrams. This is the TL algebra - an algebra
of considerable significance in many areas of mathematics and physics.
<p>
A handy way to think of the TL algebra is as a quotient of the Hecke algebra,
which is in turn a quotient of the group algebra of the braid group.
<p>
Finally,...
The blob algebra is a generalisation of the TL algebra as we now indicate.
