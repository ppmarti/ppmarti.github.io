<h2> Geometry/set partition Notes</h2>
There is no low-dimensional geometry in the partition algebra.
But there are substructures 
and enhancements with geometrical features
<!--
(such as Coxeter generators - see e.g. [Humphreys]).
-->.
This leads to various interesting bits of maths - in particular
some combinatorics.
<p>
<h3> The line and the plane and non-crossing partitions</h3>
As usual we represent set partitions by graphs. 
<br>
We then specify a graph (and hence a set partition)
by a picture drawn in the plane.
<br>
Vertices are represented by points of the plane, and edges are
lines between points.
<p>
We say that a graph picture is non-crossing if no two lines
meet except possibly at their endpoints.
<p>

In 
particular suppose we consider partitions of {1,2,...,n}
(with {1,2,...,n} 
considered as an ordered set in the natural way).
Then we may draw our graph with lines restricted to the 
upper half-plane, and represent the elements as points on the 
boundary line (the x-axis) in the 
natural way. 
(There are several examples in the main figure 
<a href="fuss.html"> here </a>.)
<br>
In this case we have the notion of a non-crossing partition
- a partition having a non-crossing representing graph picture.
<br>
We write NCP_n for the set of non-crossing partitions of {1,2,...,n}.
<p>
The following figure shows how to map a non-crossing partition on 
{1,2,...,n} to a non-crossing pair partition on {1,2,...,2n}.
The figure first shows a neighbourhood of a single vertex
in a picture of a non-crossing partition as above,
and shows edges arriving at that single vertex.
The figure then illustrates how to convert
this to edges arriving at a pair of vertices.

The case of a vertex with no incoming edges is the natural degeneration of this. 
Thus altogether we have something like
the following image of the partition {{1,2,4},{3}}:

It is straightforward to see that this defines a bijection
<br>
beta: NCP_n --> NCPP_2n.
