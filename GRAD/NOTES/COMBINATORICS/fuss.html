<h2> Symmetric group/geometry/set partition Notes</h2>
There is no low-dimensional geometry in the symmetric group.
But there are substructures 
and enhancements with geometrical features
(such as Coxeter generators - see e.g. [Humphreys]).
This leads to various interesting bits of maths - in particular
some combinatorics.
<p>
<h3> The line and the plane </h3>
We start by explaining the figure 

<br>

<img src="../../../IMAGES/perm2part2.gif" width="280cm">
<img src="clus6xxx.jpg" width="300" align="right">

<br>

This figure (from [MarshMartin06]) summarizes various maps. 
<br>
The first is the chi map 
from S_n to the set of set partitions of a set of order n.
<br>
For a perm p 
(an element of S_n written as the image of sequence 123...n _after_ the 
permutation has been applied)
<br>
then chi(p) is the relation with pair (i,j) 
whenever i>j and i immediately precedes j in p.
<br>
(Note here that we are using an underlying property of the set 
being permuted - a property not intrinsic to S_n.)
<br>
The partition obtained from this relation is the RST closure.
<p>
Note that this map is not injective.
<p>
Next we need the notion of c-sort.
Let c be a word in the Coxeter generators containing one copy of each.
<br>
(We can take c=s_1 s_2 ... s_{n-1} here.)
<br>
Then every perm may be obtained from some power of c (as a word)
by deleting some factors.
<br>
Consider the set of factors kept from each `block' 
(copy of c). If the set
from block i is a subset of the set from block i-1 for all i then
p is c-sortable.
<br>
CLAIM: chi is a bijection from c-sortable elements to non-crossing partitions. 
<br>
Next we need a bijection from c-sortable elements to c-clusters.
<br>
One fixes a reference triangulation of the n+2-gon 
- in our case we take a fan triangulation,
with the diagonals numbered consecutively.
Each triangulation then gives (relative to the reference)
a cluster - the list of 
sets of numbered fan diagonals crossed by each diagonal.

...

<p>
Homework:
c-clusters are in bijection with diagonal triangulations of the n-gon.
How can we lift this 
whole setup
to m+2-angulations of the sm+2-gon?
