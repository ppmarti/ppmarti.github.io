\section{Introductory notes on partition categories}
There are several different ways to define partition categories.
We look at a couple here. One approach (coming from 
the partition function/transfer matrix/partition vector
formalism in Statistical Mechanics - see e.g. [M91])
is to think in terms of `gluing graphs together'.

\subsection{Heuristic definition}
</a>
<!--
Before giving a technical definition let us give a quick heuristic 
definition of a simple case of a partition category.
Firstly
(purely as a warm-up exercise)
recall that the category $\underline{Set}$
\[
\underline{Set}  = (Sets, hom(-,-), \circ )
\]
has object class the class of sets, hom(A,B) is set maps and $\circ$
is function composition. 
There is a full isomorphism dense subcategory 
of the subcategory of finite sets in which sets are replaced
by their cardinalities. That is, the object set is 
$\N_0$.
Function compositions can be computed pictorially using, for example,
mapping diagrams:
<p>
<img src="venn1.jpg" width="130" align="centre">  <p>

The partition category may be defined as follows.
Fix a commutative ring $k$ and $\delta\in k$.
Consider the triple 
\[
P  = (\N_0 , kP(n,m) , *)
\]
where $P(S)$ denotes the set partitions of set $S$; and 
$P(n,m) = P(\underline{n} \sqcup \underline{m})$
where $\underline{n} = \{ 1 ,2, ..., n \}$. 
The composition $*$ can be described as follows. 

Firstly one draws a picture of a set partition $p$ of 
`vertex set' $S=\underline{n} \sqcup \underline{m}$ 
as a graph drawn in a rectangular box, with the elements of $S$ drawn on 
the frame: $\underline{n}$ on the northern edge; and $\underline{m}$ on
the southern. 
Two elements of $S$ are in the same part if they are in the same
graph component. For example:
<p>
<img src="partit1.jpg" width="370" >
<p>
Given pictures of a composable pair of partitions $p,p'$ one draws $p*p'$
as the stack of the two pictures, identifying the `middle' sets
of vertices (just as for the set map composition above - 
except that we have rotated the pictures to remind ourselves
that these are _not_ set maps <em>per se</em>):
<p> 
<img src="partit3.jpg" width="410" >

<p>
We
recover a partition from the stack as indicated. If $c$ internal
connected graph components are discarded in this process 
one scales by a factor $\delta^c$, again as indicated.
<p>

It is an exercise to check the axioms. 
Next we will try to be a little more precise about the definition of $P$.

\subsubsection{Disjoint Set notations (Click Me)}
</font>
</a>
        <div id="myvar102" style="overflow:hidden;display:none">


Here $S$ is a set. 
For $i$ any suitable symbol, $S^i = S \times \{ i \}$.
<br>
Thus $S^\alpha \cup S^1 \cup S^0$ contains three distinct copies of $S$.
<br>
(The notation $S^2 = S \times S$ is also used, but our intention
will always be clear by context.)
<br>

Define $\sigma : \Z \rightarrow \Z$ by $\sigma(i)=i+1$.
Define $\sigma_- : \Z \rightarrow \Z$ by
$\sigma_-(2)=1$
and $\sigma_-(i)=i$ otherwise.

If $\alpha \in \Z$ then 
$\iota^\sigma: S^\alpha \rightarrow S^{\sigma(\alpha)}$
is given by $(x,\alpha) \mapsto (x,\sigma(\alpha) )$.
Extend this naturally so that $\iota^\sigma (S^1 \cup T^0) = S^2 \cup T^1$
and $\iota^{\sigma_-} (S^2 \cup T^0) = S^1 \cup T^0$
and so on. 

</div>

$P_{S}(T)$ denotes the set of subsets of set $T$ whose orders lie in 
list $S \subset \N$. 
Example: 
$P_{1,2}(\{a,b,c \}) 
= \{ \{ a \}, \{ b \} , \{ c \}, \{ a,b \} , \{ a,c \} , \{ b,c \} \}$. 

%$\mathbb{M,N}$

\subsubsection{Graphs }

An <em>(undirected) graph</em> is a triple $g=(V,E,f)$ where $V,E$ are sets 
(vertex set and edge set respectively) and 
$f:E \rightarrow P_{1,2}(V)$.
(A handy reference using a slightly different notation is <a href="http://cr.yp.to/2005-261/bender2/GT.pdf"> here </a>.)

\subsubsection{Graphs and pictures}

It will be useful to
 represent a graph $g$
on a countable vertex set by a
picture. 
For an exposition, see 
<a href="pcat-pic.html">here</a>
or
<a href="pcat-pic1.html">here</a>
.

%Exercise: 
%It will be useful to 
% represent a graph $g$ on a countable vertex set by a picture. 
A <em>plane drawn picture</em>
$d = \ppic$
is a closed rectangular interval of the plane $R$ together with
a label set $V$, an injective map 
$\lambda : V \rightarrow R$, and  a subset $S$ of $R$ 
consisting of smoothly embedded line intervals terminating at
certain of the marked points $\lambda: V$. 
<br>
(Obviously such a thing can only be approximated by a `drawn picture' in the 
artistic sense, but we will use PDPs in such a way that 
such approximations are
generally sufficient. With this caveat we will speak of `drawing' PDPs,
and indeed speak of pictures such as the one on the left as if they
are PDPs.)
<p>
<a name="alcove"></a>
An <em> alcove </em> of such a picture $\ppic$ is a connected component of 
$R \setminus S$. 
(See also <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/algebraicstatisticalmechanics/Home/tutorial-reviews/kramers-wannier-duality/geometric-preliminaries">here</a>.)

<a name="pdp"></a>
<a name="pdpgen"></a>

A set of line interval embeddings is
<em>generic</em>
if when two lines  meet at an unmarked point the tangents do not coincide;
(we may also require that no third line  passes through
such a point;)
and no line meets a marked point except at an endpoint.
<p>
In order to represent a graph $g=(V,E,f)$ by such a picture $\ppic$,
one proceeds as follows. 
First one draws  marked points such that each may be identified with a 
 vertex in $V$. 
Each edge $\epsilon$ in $E$ is then represented by a line interval
between the vertices in $f(\epsilon)$, and labelled by $\epsilon$.
There is much freedom of choice in this, but one wants 
that a complete single line can be determined unambiguously from the
drawn set of lines.
To this end the set of line interval embeddings is
chosen to be 
<br>
&nbsp
<em>generic</em>.
<br>
(This is sophistry, in that it is not really possible to determine
tangents to lines by looking at drawn pictures, except within some tolerance.
Thus if we use pictures in practice, tangents must not only be 
different, but sufficiently different.)
<p>
In such a picture we shall call the boundary of the rectangular region
the <em> frame </em>.
A vertex may lie on the frame (call such a vertex <em>exterior</em>), 
but by convention 
a line interval may touch the frame
only at its endpoints.

\subsection{Notation for Graphs II}
\subsubsection{Graphs: constructions, conventions and notations}
A graph is <em> loop-free </em> if $f(E) $ contains no singletons.
<br>
If $g$ is a specific graph then $V_g$ is the vertex set $V$ of $g$
and $E=E_g$.
(We sometimes write just $g$ for the vertex set.)
<br>
$\Gamma_1(S)$ denotes the class of loop-free undirected graphs on vertex set $S$.
<br>
$\Gamma_1$ denotes the class of loop-free undirected graphs.

 For $g,g'$ graphs, define $g \cup_\gamma g'$ as the graph
with vertex set the union of vertex sets and edge set the
disjoint union of edge sets.
<br>

If the vertex set of a graph is not specified 
(in a picture of a graph, say) then we take it to be `generic'.
That is, the union of two graphs with unspecified vertex sets would be disjoint.


Exercise:
Consider how one might realise the composition $\cup_\gamma$ on <em>
pictures</em> of graphs.

<p> 
\subsubsection{Relative graphs}

An $S$-graph 
(or a <em> relative graph on set </em> $S$)
is a graph $g$ together with a map 
$\lambda_g : S \rightarrow V_g$
(called the structure map of $g$). 
<br>

$\Gamma(S)$ denotes the class of  undirected $S$-graphs. 
<br>

Notes on relative graphs and compatibility (Click Me)
</font>
</a>
        <div id="myvar003" style="overflow:hidden;display:none">


Note that the structure map $\lambda_g$ is a kind of (possibly partial) 
 labelling of vertices of $g$ by labels
from $S$. A vertex may have no label, or multiple labels.
<!-- 
(in which case we shall say that it is improperly labeled). 
-->
But each label only appears on one vertex.
If a vertex has precisely one label in this way then we shall say
that it is properly labeled. 
<br>
Sometimes we may just write $g$ for the $S$-graph $(g,\lambda_g)$.
<br>

Note that any non-trivial graph can be made into an $S$-graph
(for example by mapping all of $S$ to one vertex).
<br>
Note that if $(g,\lambda_g)$ is an $S$-graph then so is 
$(g \cup_\gamma g'  , \lambda_g)$ for any graph $g'$,
since $\lambda_g : S \rightarrow g$ is also a map
$\lambda_g : S \rightarrow g\cup g'$  in an obvious way.
<br>

However the union of an $S$-graph and a $T$-graph does not necessarily 
define an $S\cup T$-graph, since, if $S,T$ intersect, there may be an
element of the intersection to which the structure maps asign a different
vertex (as if $g,g'$ do not intersect as graphs, for example).
<br>
If $g,g'$ make the same asignment to every element in $S \cap T$ we say 
they are <em>compatible</em>.
<br>

Whenever $g,g'$ are compatible then the graph union extends to define
an $S \cup T$-graph via:
$$
\lambda_{g \cup_\gamma g'} (s) = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ccc} 
\lambda_g (s) & if  \;\; s \in S
\\
\lambda_{g'} (s) & if \;\; s \in T 
\end{array}
\right.
$$ 

Note that our construction makes a distinction between vertices of $g$ and 
their structure map labels. However the compatibility condition
on a pair $g,g'$
requires that a  vertex with a label from $S \cap T$
is not generic -- the vertex is
effectively identified with one of its labels. The compatibility 
condition ensures that $g \cup_\gamma g'$ does not depend on which one.

Exercise: check this.

\begin{proposition}\label{prcompat1}
Let $g \in \Gamma(S)$ and $g' \in \Gamma(T)$. 
If both structure maps are injective on $S \cap T$ then we can take $S \cap T$ 
to be the set of labels for the corresponding set of vertices.
In this way we can consider $g,g'$ to be compatible. 
\end{proposition}

<!-- Suppose $\gamma_g$ is injective.
-->
If $\phi :S \rightarrow T$ is invertible, 
and $g \in \Gamma(S)$,
then $\phi (g)$ is the $T$-graph $(g,\kappa_g)$
given by $\kappa_g = \lambda_g \circ \phi^{-1}$. 
<br>
Example: Suppose that $S= \{ s_1 , s_2 , s_3 \}$ and $T = \{ t_1 , t_2 , t_3 \}$
and $U = \{ u_1 , u_2 \}$. Then an example of a 
picture of a 
relative graph
$f \in \Gamma(S^1 \cup T^0)$ is:

<p>
<br>
$\Gamma(S,T) $ denotes the subset of $ \Gamma(S^1 \cup T^0)$
of elements whose structure maps are injective on $S^1$ and $T^0$
separately (but not necessarily on the union). 
<br>
An example of a $g \in \Gamma(S,T)$, and an $h \in \Gamma(T,U)$ is:
<!--
\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{xfig/graph-h1.gif}

</tr>
</table>
</p>

In such cases we will generally (unlike here) draw the vertices labeled from the 
first subset in a row; and similarly for the second subset. 
Note that the two rows may (and may necessarily) lie on the same line. 

Exercise: compute $ \iota^{\sigma} (g) \cup_\gamma h  $ here.  

Answer: Firstly $ \iota^{\sigma} (g)$ is :

<p align='left'>
<table><tr> 
<td> $\iota^{\sigma} (g ) \; = \;\; $  </td><td>
<img 
src="xfig/graph-g22.gif"
border=1
style="border-color:#e1eeee;background-color:#e1eeee"   
>
</td>
<td> 
$\in \Gamma(S^2 \cup T^1)$; $\qquad$ 
</td><td>
</td><td>
$\;\;$ 
which can also be drawn, for example, as 
$ \;  \;\; $  </td><td>
<img 
src="xfig/graph-g23.gif"
border=1
style="border-color:#e1eeee;background-color:#e1eeee"   
>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

We see from this 
and Prop.\ref{prcompat1}
that $ \iota^{\sigma} (g) $ and $ h  $ are compatible.
We have:
<p align='left'>
<table><tr> 
<td> $\iota^{\sigma} (g ) \cup_\gamma h \; = \;\; $  </td><td>
<img 
src="xfig/graph-g23h1.gif"
border=1
style="border-color:#e1eeee;background-color:#e1eeee"   
>
</td></tr></table></p>

Another useful convention for drawing relative graphs in case a vertex
has multiple labels is to draw a separate copy of this vertex for each
label, with a `hard link' between.
For example, our $\iota^\sigma( g)$ may be drawn:
<p align='left'>
<table><tr>
<td> $\iota^\sigma (g )  \; = \;\; $  </td><td>
<img 
src="xfig/graph-g23k1.gif"
border=1
style="border-color:#e1eeee;background-color:#e1eeee"   
>
</td>
<td> ; &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp;  </td>
<td> $ h \; = \;\; $  </td><td>
<img 
src="xfig/graph-h1k1.gif"
border=1
style="border-color:#e1eeee;background-color:#e1eeee"   
>
</td>
</tr></table></p>

This allows us to give each label subset its own distinct row.
Suppose further that we draw a label subset in a given order from 
left to right (let us say, the natural order, if the set has one).
By a suitable choice of spacing of vertices in the two drawings,
the $\cup_\gamma$ composition is then realised simply 
by a concatenation of drawings:
<p align='left'>
<table><tr> 
<td> $\iota^{\sigma} (g ) \cup_\gamma h \; = \;\; $  </td><td>
<img 
src="xfig/graph-gh1k1.gif"
border=1
style="border-color:#e1eeee;background-color:#e1eeee"   
>
</td></tr></table></p>

The reader will readily verify that this is the same as the original answer,
redrawn using the hard-link convention.
(Of course there are many equivalent such drawings.)

<br>
If $(g , \lambda_g )$ an $S$-graph and 
$T \subset S$ then $g|_{T}$ denotes the $T$-graph obtained from 
$(g,\lambda_g )$ by restricting the map to $T$.
