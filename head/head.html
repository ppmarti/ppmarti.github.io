Welcome. I am Paul Martin, a professor in the School.
I am now into my second stint as
<!-- I was until relatively recently -->
head of the Department of 
Pure Mathematics. 
Here are a few personal thoughts on ...
</font>

<center>
<H2>Some research strengths in the School under heading ``pure maths''</H2>
</center>

<font size="2">
... intended as an ultra-light overview, 
for not-necessarily-Mathematical visitors to the School.

Firstly some informal defining of terms from the  heading above:
<p>
Pure maths := 
not necessarily applied maths
(i.e., 
maths the importance of which extends beyond a single application)
<!--
maths that is important not only due to a specific application)
-->
<br>
strength := internationally agenda setting activity
<p>

<b>Mathematics</b> is the language and toolkit of science and technology.
This is a demand-side perspective on Mathematics. 
<br>
On the supply-side we have the benefits of abstraction;
and the capacity for intrinsic beauty. 

<p>
<p  style="background-color:#ddddff;">
Pure Mathematics is sometimes broken down,
for bookkeeping purposes, 
 into four intrinsic subdisciplines:
<br>
algebra; 
analysis; 
geometry and 
number theory.<sup>1,2</sup>
<!--
<br>
(These should perhaps be thought of as regions in a continuum,
with overlapping umbras, penumbras and so on.)
-->
<br>
Overarching these is a more foundational discipline of logic, 
consisting roughly of computability; model theory and proof theory. 
<br>
Leeds Pure Maths is a large research activity in the field,
in terms of staff numbers, 
and we aim to be active in 
all of 
these disciplines. In practice, 
of these disciplines at Leeds only number theory is presently 
missing as a research strength.
<br>
Furthermore, 
in practice there is no clear division between activities in 
Pure and Applied mathematics, and the overall 
connected nature of strong research 
activity at Leeds across the wide spectrum of mathematics 
is a particularly striking feature.
</p>
<p  style="background-color:#ffddff;">
Some random examples of strengths are
EPSRC funded projects (including a Programme Grant) in, or involving: 
<br>
cluster algebras ; 
diagram algebras ;
``topological'' quantum groups ; 
applications of geometry to theoretical physics (e.g. ``type-1.5 superconductors'') ; 
homotopy-type theory, 
and indeed all of the abovementioned aspects of logic.
<p>
In practice the best way to follow our work is probably through our 
scholarly and research articles. 
<br>
These are published in international research journals;
are also often found on the <a href="http://arxiv.org/"> arXiv </a>;
and often on our homepages.
<br>
Here are some indicative examples
(in fact these examples are from my first stint as HoD - I will do a round
of updates shortly):

...more to follow
</ul>

<p  style="background-color:#ddffff;">
We also run a large number 
(typically more than one per day)
of open-to-the-public research seminars in the area.
<br>
From time to time we run international research conferences and
workshops (day long or even week-long sessions with multiple
speakers from research groups around the world,
covering research themes and agendas set by workers here at Leeds). 
</p>

<p>
Examples of bodies that fund our work (for a variety of reasons of their own)
include 
<a href="http://www.hefce.ac.uk/">HEFCE</a>, 
EPSRC, 
<a href="http://royalsociety.org/">RS</a>, 
Leverhulme, IMA, IoP, LMS, EU, USAF, Templeton, ...
<p>
This page is about research, but 
we adhere to the 
<a href="http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/">Russell Group</a> 
philosophy that university teaching and 
research function symbiotically.

Footnotes: <br>
1. These subdisciplines should perhaps be thought of as 
regions in a mathematical continuum,
with overlapping umbras, penumbras and so on.
If the study of (a) sets and relations; (b) functions;
(c) shapes; and (d) numbers
can be considered as points in this continuum, then "algebra"
would be the collection of activities closest to (a),
"analysis" closest to (b), and so on. 
<br>
(Care is needed with such characterisations since, 
for example, (a) contains (b);
but never mind!)
<br>
Of course one might prefer to subdivide mathematics according to 
its <em>applications</em>
(or at the other extreme by its axioms), 
and one would be perfectly entitled to do this.
<p>
2. Organisationally, the School includes "research groups" with 
some similar names to these. 
This is a different story however, articulating some strategic
research <em>aims</em> of the School
- which are often cross-disciplinary. 
For example
the AGIS Research Group contains Integrable Systems while the
Analysis Research Group does not, although IS is at least as close
to (b) as it is to (a,c)!
<p>
3. J Partington says of this paper: "A massive (and technically a tour-de-force) paper in one of the leading journals for Analysis. This is combining some of the latest ideas in Banach space theory - in particular, constructions used to solve major open questions - in an operator-theoretic context."

To reiterate, everything on this page is the responsibility of myself,
Paul Martin. 
I wrote it when I was Head of Department, but I am not writing here
in that capacity.
