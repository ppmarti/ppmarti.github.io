Consider a physical array G of simple microscopic components, such as atoms or
magnetic dipoles (but generically called <em>spins</em>), in a crystal lattice. 
Let S denote the set of all possible states of this array. 
<p>
Our picture illustrates a (quite realistic) model of a physical system
G in which 
each spin is a dipole, and it's state is given by its orientation relative
to the lattice. 
Our picture is almost entirely <em>quenched</em>. 
That is to say, most spins
are shown frozen in a particular orientation. But 
one spin in particular is illustrated visiting each of
four different orientations. 
<p>

When G holds heat energy 
(i.e. at finite temperatures) it may be thought of as wandering
through S. The amount of time it spends, typically, in each state,
depends on the microscopic details of that state, and on the amount of
heat energy available. 
Determined by the microscopic interactions of the spins, 
there will be a certain energy <em>requirement</em> associate to each state. 
The higher
this requirement, the less time the system is likely to spend in that state. 
To <em> model </em> the system mathematically we must capture this behavior. 
<p>
Let H denote a map from S to the real numbers, called the 
HAMILTONIAN of the array. 
Let b be a variable proportional to the 
inverse temperature, then 
for each such H the <em>partition function</em> Z is defined as follows.

where <em>f</em>(x,y) 
depends on the <em>relative</em> orientation, 
and the sum is over nearest neighbour
pairs of spins on the lattice (a typical spin in our pictured lattice
has 4 nearest neighbours). 
<p>
Amongst physical systems like the one represented in our picture, 
it is realistic in many cases to suppose 
that the set of allowed orientations of a single spin is discrete (and hence
finite). Even if this is not the case, we may often 
<em>model</em> the set of orientations with a discrete set, without
losing realistic features from the model. In either case 
we may represent it by the set Q_={1,2,...,Q} (some Q); 
whereupon S=hom(G,Q_). 

In this case, if the lattice is finite, 
and H maps to the rationals, 
then the partition function is a polynomial in e<sup>b</sup>.

For a concrete example of a model, let us take Q=4 and 
<em>f</em>(x,y)=<em>f</em>(x-y)=<em>f</em>(-x+y) and 
(<em>f</em>(0),<em>f</em>(1),<em>f</em>(2))=(3,1,0).
This picture then shows the zeros of Z, plotted in the complex
e<sup>b</sup> plane, for three different lattice
sizes - 6x13, 8x13, 10x13 (each periodic in the shorter direction and
open in the longer direction). 
<p>
Press STOP on your browser to stop the animation at a particular
lattice size. 
<p>
It is worth noting that these are very small systems in physical terms 
(Avogadro's number is of order 10<sup>26</sup>). However the sum in Z
is over 4<sup>130</sup> terms, and the degree of the resultant polynomial, which
must be factorized to obtain these pictures, is of order
10<sup>3</sup>. Thus the computations involved are still staggeringly
large! 
Also, as the animation shows, the large scale features of the
distribution of zeros are already quite stable over this range of lattice
sizes. The main change as the system gets bigger is that the `lines'
of zeros appoaching the positive real axis end up <em>closer</em> to
the axis. 
We will examine the consequences for physics of this feature of the
model shortly. 
<p>
In these pictures only the positive real axis has any direct relevance to
physics. The interval [0,1] is the `antiferromagnetic' region, in the
sense that the Hamiltonian encourages spins to be anti-aligned; and
the remainder of the axis is the ferromagnetic region. 
By symmetry the picture for the <em>f</em>=(3,2,0) model is the
<em>same</em> 
if plotted in  e<sup>-b</sup>. 

<a name="mo"><h3>3. Interpretation of results</h3></a>
Let us know try to get a <em>flavour</em> of what these results may
tell us. 
As our discussion of
<a href="StatMechIntro.html#ob">observables</a> 
shows, Z appears in the denominator in the
modelling of physical quantities. As such, zeros of Z approaching the
physical  axis signal dramatic variations in these quantities. These
dramatic variations are the closest a finite system can come to
representing <em>phase transitions</em>. Thus, roughly speaking,
the lines of zeros pinching the physical axis signal that the points
being pinched are candidates for phase transition points. 
<p>
In our example we thus have clear evidence for a (single) phase
transition in the ferromagnetic (3,1,0) model. 
This is in agreement with the standard heuristic picture for these models. 
Perhaps more
interesting is the two-pronged structure in the neighbourhood of the 
ferromagnetic (3,2,0) model. 
Might this suggest three phases?
<p>
These Q=4 clock models (or Ashkin-Teller models) have been the subject
of considerable study. 
The (2,1,0) model is well known to factorise as two copies of the
Ising model (the unique Q=2 model), and as such it is known to have
only two phases in the ferromagnetic region. This structure breaks,
but only degenerately, when the coupling strengths are anisotropic 
(i.e., allowed to vary between
the two natural lattice directions, so that the two Ising models
disorder at two different temperatures). 
While it has been argued that <em>isotropic</em> 
Q>4 models exhibit three `topologically' distinct phases with a suitable choice of
<em>f</em>, 
it has been thought, in some quarters, 
that all isotropic Q=4 models have only two
phases - so our picture presents rather an intriguing new datum! 
It does not contradict this view, since the tips in the two-pronged structure
get closer together as the lattice size increases (so they
may yet converge in the limit).
However it does suggest that the realisation of phase structure is
more subtle in this region.
<! and hence that these systems may merit further investigation... >
<p>
Exercise: Compute the partition function and zeros for the 12x13
lattice (and so on as necessary), 
and hence determine the phase structure of the (3,2,0) model.
