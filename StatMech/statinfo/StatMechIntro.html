In classical (or quantum) equilibrium Statistical Mechanics the key 
computational object is the <em>partition function</em> Z, defined as follows.

Consider an array G of simple microscopic components, such as atoms or
magnetic dipoles (but generically called <em>spins</em>), in a crystal lattice. 
Let S denote the set of all possible states of this array; 
and let H denote a map from S to the real numbers, called the 
HAMILTONIAN of the array. This map must have a number of other properties 
before it is likely to make sense physically, but for the moment reality is 
enough. In a given system (in particular for given S and H) the partition function
depends only on the temperature. Let b be a variable proportional to the 
inverse temperature, then

<br>In other words the expectation value is a weighted sum 
over S of the value of the
observable in each state. The denominator allows the weight, called the
<em>Boltzman weight</em> to be 
interpreted as a probability. 

The Hamiltonian must be such as to 
determine the likelyhood of the system being in state x (it being, let
us say, axiomatic that a single function inserted into the exponential may do
this). In our example the weight is largest when all the spins take
the same value (the values typically represent orientations of a
dipole moment, so `taking the same value' corresponds to allignment, a
commonly energetically favourable arrangement). On the other hand,
there will be many more random configurations in S than alligned ones,
thus we have a battle between ENERGY and ENTROPY. 
<ul><li>When b is small
(high temperature) this plays down the role of the Hamiltonian and
thus measurements of the observable with high entropy will tend to dominate
the average, 
<li>when b is large (low temperature) the <em>ordered</em>
low energy configurations will be
more important. 
</ul>
If the lattice is large there may be a very dramatic switch between
the dominance of entropy and energy as b changes - a PHASE
TRANSITION. Many of the physical systems we are trying to model exhibit one or
more phase transitions.

<a name="pv"><h3>3. Computation and partition vectors</h3></a>
<!{{{> <!para>

Physically the lattice of spins is usually embeded in some Euclidean space in
such a way as to inherit a corresponding topology, in terms of which
the interactions in the Hamiltonian are local.  
<img SRC="figs/lattice3p1.gif" height=190 width=215 align=LEFT>
Suppose that the interations are
in fact short ranged, as in our example (and not, typically, as in
physical systems, but the approximation is not too crude to capture
the important features), and between
pairs of spins. Then the
set of pairs of spins with a finite interaction between them defines a
graph G of H. 
(Henceforth i in G will mean the site of a spin, a <em>vertex</em>
in G; while (i,j) in G will mean the edge associated to the interaction
between the spins at sites i and j.)  
<p>
<!}}}>
<!{{{> <!para>
Now consider any subset L' of the set L<sub>s</sub> of
spins in the lattice with the property that 
the maximal subgraph of G not 
intersecting L' breaks into (at least) two parts (with spin sets
L<sub>l</sub> and L<sub>r</sub>, say). 
<!{{{> <! junk>
<! ; and that the 
full subgraph of G on the union of the spins in any one of these parts
with L'. --no need to worry about this!>
<!}}}>
<br>
<img SRC="figs/donuts18s2.gif" height=170 width=215 align=RIGHT>
Formally L' might be any subset, but it is usually helpful to think of
a set of spins lying on the boundary of the lattice exposed when the
embedding space is cut in half somehow. 
Write L for the pair (L<sub>l</sub>,L') and define a vector Z<sup>L</sup> in
the space S<sub>L'</sub> of states of L', such that
Z<sup>L</sup><sub>i</sub> is the partition function of the 
system on L<sub>l</sub>UL' when the spins in L' are fixed in state i. This is the
<em>partition vector</em> of the pair (L<sub>l</sub>,L').
For example, suppose our lattice is embedded in a double torus (as
shown on the right), and
L' is the set of spins on a cut which separates this into
two punctured toruses, one of which is illustrated in
the figure on the left  
<br>
<img SRC="figs/donuth1e1.gif" height=190 width=215 align=LEFT>
(what constitutes being `on' a cut for these purposes depends on
H through the range of the interactions, but let us stick with our
example). 
Let M=(L<sub>r</sub>,L'), 
whose spins intersect with L in L'. Then the partition function for
the entire lattice is 
<p>
Z = Z<sup>L</sup> . Z<sup>M</sup>
<p>
(provided only that we take care with the accounting for the
interactions <em>within</em> L'). 
<p>

<!}}}>
<!{{{> <! para>
<br>
<img SRC="figs/plumb4s.gif" height=190 width=215 align=LEFT>
Note that we could equally well define a partition vector 
for a still smaller lattice portion by making two parallel 
(or at least non-intersecting) cuts, and 
discarding both of the pieces which intersect only one of the cuts, to
leave a system having two exterior spin sets. (In our pictorial example we 
would discard both singly punctured tori to leave a `connecting' tube.) 
Indeed we could 
arrange such a vector as a matrix, with row and column positions
indexed by the states of the two sets of exterior spins. 
Note that if one exterior set L' is in some sense a translate of the
other then this matrix lies in End(k S<sub>L'</sub>) (some suitable k), 
and raising this 
<em>transfer matrix</em> T to a power would correspond to obtaining 
the partition vector for a longer tube. 
<p>
<!}}}>
<a name="tm"><h3>4. Transfer matrices</h3></a>
<!{{{> <!para>
Consider the basic example of the square lattice we started with. 
In this case the partition function may be built up using the 
transfer matrix for a single layer as shown on the right (here we have
indicated how we might share the interactions within layers so as to
avoid double counting). 
<br>
<img SRC="figs/lattice4.gif" height=190 width=215
align=RIGHT>
Fixing the spins on the exterior of the whole lattice to states i and
j, say, we have 
<p>
Z<sub>ij</sub> = (T<sup>n</sup>)<sub>ij</sub>
<p>
where n is the linear dimension. 
(Indeed note that exactly the same formal construction works for building a
cubic lattice out of square lattice layers, as illustrated below.) 
Since the matrix is positive, so long as it is finite  
there is a unique largest magnitude eigenvalue which is positive and
has an eigenvector which is also positive (Peron Frobenius theorem). 
Thus (summing over all exterior boundary conditions i,j) 
the partition function Z will be dominated, for large n, by this
eigenvalue. 
<br>
<img SRC="figs/latticed3-3x5.gif" height=190 width=215
align=LEFT>
In our example the only analytic structure Z can have as a 
function of b is zeros, and we now
see that none of these lie on the real b axis. This implies a
similarly bland behaviour for observables, with the only escape being
to take the lattice size to a large limit. 
On the other hand many (perhaps all) physical systems exhibiting phase
transitions are finite (albeit very large), so our model should
provide <em>some</em> way of detecting phase transitions even on the finite
lattice. It does, as we shall see, but for now we note that
essentially everything is determined by the spectrum of T, and so turn
our attention to the computation of this spectrum. 

<!}}}>
<!{{{> <!para>
<p>
<ul><li>
If the model is <em>integrable</em> (a consumation widely sought) then
the eigenvalue problem may be amenable to solution based on a series
of sophisticated guesses for the form of the eigenvectors. 
<li>
Before
this, if there is translation or other symmetry in the system then fourier
transformation may help with diagonalisation. 
<li>
And before even this,
there is help to be had if it happens that the transfer matrix at
fixed b is the
representation of an element of a familiar algebra (the algebra
and representation obtained being independent of b, so that the
general T may be thought of as a representation of an algebra valued
function of b). 
This helps if the representation is reducible (as in practice it
usually is), since the formal descent to the irreducible components is
effectively a block diagonalisation of T. 
We will begin by looking at this possibility. 
</ul>
<!}}}>
<a name="tma"><h3>5. Transfer matrix algebras</h3></a>
<!{{{> <!para>
In order to extract a transfer matrix algebra from T it is necesary
that, in a certain sense, the algebraic and analytic sides of T decouple. That
is to say, functional aspects reside in the scalar coefficient ring,
while non-commutative aspects reside in constant matrices. To
illustrate this we will use our Potts model example.
<p> 
<!}}}>
<!{{{> <!para>
Consider the matrix acting on
kS<sub>L'</sub> which has the effect of modifying Z<sup>L</sup> by
the inclusion of just one more interaction. A complete set of such
matrices would add an entire `layer' of interactions, internalising
the L' layer, thus their product is the layer transfer
matrix T. If the layer contains n spins, and V is the space with
basis Q_, then T acts on the tensor product V<sup>n</sup>. 
Each single interaction matrix
will act trivially on all but one or two of these factor spaces
<ul>
<li>if the interaction is from this layer to the next, then the new
partition vector Z' with new external spin s<sub>i</sub>' (and
s<sub>i</sub> internalised) is given by 
<p>
Z'|<sub>{s<sub>i</sub>'=k}</sub> = 
Z|<sub>{s<sub>i</sub>=1}</sub> + Z|<sub>{s<sub>i</sub>=2}</sub> + 
...+ Z|<sub>{s<sub>i</sub>=k-1}</sub> + 
e<sup>b</sup> Z|<sub>{s<sub>i</sub>=k}</sub> +
Z|<sub>{s<sub>i</sub>=k+1}</sub> +...
<p>
so the local transfer matrix T<sub>i</sub> acts non-trivially on one
copy of V only, where it has all off-diagonal
entries 1, and all diagonal entries e<sup>b</sup>;
<li>if between two spins i,j within the layer then T<sub>ij</sub> is
diagonal on VxV with entry e<sup>b</sup> when the two spins are the
same, and entry 1 otherwise. 
</ul>
(NB different models will
involve tensor factors in different ways.)
