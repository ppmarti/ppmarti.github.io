LATEST (20/8/15): 
We have moved  to the 
 new Maths offices.

Finding Room 8.17 is easy once you have found the School of Maths.
<br>
Prof Charles Taylor
has a great set of instructions for finding the
School of Maths from Leeds Station

<!-- P.s. Another useful room to know in Maths is 9.19a - the Staff Coffee Room!

Room 9.18n is quite close by.
